Serial NO,                  Game Name,                                Review,    Positive/Negative
1,PUBG mobile,"Controls are inevitably a little awkward until you get used to them and there is just one map, but this is a tense shooter that will suck you right in",0
2,PUBG mobile,"Love the game. Amazing graphics, etc. The only problem is that sometimes it does load a bit longer for mobile devices. Also, it occasionally but rarely lags a bit but I guess that's cause of the internet. Overall, great game. Highly recommend it. (Since the new resident evil update happened I've been getting laggier and laggier. Idk what's causing it but if it's the update then it has to be fixed)",1
3,PUBG mobile,"Best FPS game.but one thing I have noticed today, that is Church. Church is a holy place, so it should not be source of ammunition. Church is good for hiding and exploring but guns, generades should be removed. What if a teenage, a lover of pubg walks with his father passing near a church and tell his father ""It is the place where we find loot"", you know what I mean. All holy places have its dignity and should be maintained by each and every individual. Please remove ammunitions from Church.",0
4,Candy Crush Saga,"SUGGESTION: I would like to suggest a type of ""Candy Bandit"" level where you can shoot the candy out of the sky while collecting candy, points, and special candy - before you get ""crushed"" by the candy bandit or blown up by those hateful candy bombs.. Candy Crush Saga is a SWEET way to pass time on",1
5,Candy Crush Saga,"Game is not fun anymore. The developers make the game easy to start,get you hooked. I have played this game for almost 6 years, and am far in. I have spend money on it. But I am going on every site I can encouraging people to Not download this game.",0
6,Criminal Case,"This game is fun. If you like spot the difference or memory games, then this is for you. Sometimes its frustrating as you run out of energy, but you can make in app purchases which can give you more. You can also speed the investigations along by making purchases as well, but that can make it pretty expensive. If you could use the coins gained to buy energy that would be awesome.",1
7,Criminal Case,I have been playing for a couple of years. I solved all the crimes that there were right to the end will you take the plane to Pacific Bay. I did not lose my stars or my money or my animal helpers or my friends or my detective level when I went to Pacific Bay. I completed all the crimes in Pacific Bay and had to fly to the next place and that was save the world. here I lost my money my animals all my friends and basically had to start all over again. That was disappointing,1
8,Criminal Case,"I've played this game for a long time. I finished Pacific Bay and was flying to a new world, which ended up being a whole new app. In order to continue, I lose all my friends, my pets, my levels. I know the game can be played in the original app because my husband still plays all worlds in his Criminal Case game without downloading another one, keeping all his friends, pets, levels, and bonuses.",0
9,Pop Slots Casino,"done it again, I keep losing, never win big, but ppl around me seem to supposedly win big, is this a gimic to make me keep going!!!! iv now payed for more coins, but again I just keep losing, the wins are not consistent, ment to be fun, but it's just wonting u to spend, I'm about to deleat this game, lets see if I lose 'again' the coins i bought.",0
10,Pop Slots Casino,"Did they make it harder to win after the update? i have better odds at a real slot machine than this game. Its fun to play but i can never win a dime. Time to find a new slot game, that actually lets you play.",0
11,Pop Slots Casino,"I'm starting to get really pissed off. Spent some money to buy coins and then POOF can't win anything and the chips are gone within 10 minutes. I'm not the only one complaing about this either. At least let me play for a good few hours before taking all my money. I'm not even betting high. Can't do anything without going through 5 plus screens of ads for buying chips and then when you cave in, you get crapped on. Can't even play everyday because you can only get so much from daily bonuses.",0
12,8 Ball pool,"not going to waste one penny on this game. its not that good. these guide lines are so long. ridiculous. how many times do i attempt to grab the cue which is on the other side of the table from the power meter but the cue decides to move instead? too many. Also, i keep getting invites to play a match by my friend who i am with at the time and isn't even on the game.",0
13,8 Ball pool," It would be a fun game if, at any time at all that I broke, I got a ball in or when my opponent breaks, they don't. Unfortunately, that isn't the case. Literally every time. It's hard at this point to not see it as a flaw on at the creators hands when, no matter my cue stick, placement on the cue ball or power of said ball or stick I always barely miss any ball sinking a pocket. and no matter what, they sink 2 stripes and a solid or three solids. I. Hate. This. Game",0
14,8 Ball pool,"The game is great fun. However, everything is monetized. It asks me to break out my plastic everywhere I look. So I tried it once. I spent like $10 of real money for a 1/4 pool stick I couldn't use. You can only use your money to buy mystery boxes, which usually yield jack. No matter how much they ask... DO NOT TAKE YOUR WALLET OUT. IT WILL GET YOU NOTHING. THEY ARE GREEDY. You even have to purchase chat packs to effectively communicate with other players. 1 star for ethics.",0
15,Angry Bird Classic,the game is now so full of Ads making it nearly unplayable. there is no purchase option that would remove the ads and improve the experience and in any case the app is so glitchy particularly on the daily challenge and master league that it would not be good value for money. Can't link to account so I can play across other devices. shame cause it used to be such a great game. Now daily challenge has not been working for over a week and master league has removed all stickers I've accumulated!!!!!,0
16,Angry Bird Classic,"I played angrybirds when they first came out and also some subsequent spin-offs. After years of inactivity I decided to try again as I was bored while on the toilet. I feel like the developers have made a wrong choice in moving the game into free to play with purchase options for upgrades, unlocks and looong ads. I would gladly have paid for the game if it retained any of the skill and persistence aspects of the original, sadly so far I don't have that feeling, but rather a feeling of nostalgia.",0
17,Angry Bird Classic,"Game is great, but app is terrible. Don't install if you can't handle constant freeze. Offline mode is getting freezed even more. So you need to exit app on device, clear ram and catch and start again. Which is frustrating and time consuming. Very bad guys. I get that you have other games or priorities, but this app is terrible now. Was better when Android 4 was popular",0
18,Temple Run,"I think I was a good day and age. I think it was not the intended recipient of a problem, 21st may have a look. if the item to you, I was just the jas for my first post a reply from my HTC Desire mobile phones and a bit more. we have been in business, we will not receive the best of all 21st. the first to review the new York. the other side. it has to do so by turning off the coast, but it was not a good time for me to but the best of all, but it wouldn't hahave thought of the year have to do to",1
19,Temple Run,At the end of your run it will ask would you like to watch an advertisement to continue you run. You decide no I don't want to watch an advertisement and you end your run to start over. They immediately make you watch an advertisement ANYWAY before they let you start anew. Pathetic! Literally makes you watch ads every time. The game is way to rudimentary for that to be honest. Don't waste your time people.,0
20,Temple Run,I dont really think it is that good. It was a tilt and you die when you tilt so ya. I would hope you work more on it and please get rid of the tilt. It dose not help you. I gave you 2 stars because I like it better if it is a game in an arcade.,0
21,Temple Run,"its HORRIBLE to me. i dont like it at all. its not like the old temple run. Where's the rope that you jump up on and slide, the chest, the gems, the objects you could get? i liked the stuff about the old temple much much much run rather than this. i dont like the update .i would not recommend this temple run if you liked the old one with all the stuff that it had",0
22,Ludo King,"Nice game. It recalls the childhood. Only one thing I dislike is advertisement of some adult topics. Ex-Docsapp. Which types of chat conversation are flashing there, it can give a bad impact on kids. Not only we adult are playing this game, kids are also playing. So, plz take care of this thing. """"I have already sent the screenshot but those ads are still playing during the game.""""",0
23,Ludo King,"Don't know why but I never won playing with friends, they always get the exact numbers on the dice which they need but I never get the numbers which I need never. That's it but if anyone else too doesn't face this same problem then it's a fun game Edit: Won my first game today infact I just won the game and updated the rating and now I know anyone can win it just depends on your luck. As I said earlier it's a fun game",1
24,Ludo King,This is not a fair game. It always decides the wining player at the begining and keeps supporting him till he wins. This is the reason why frustrated players are losing interest in the game. This is why when you go for online multiplayer game there are so few players playing. Eg. earlier we would see lakhs of player playing online but now we see only few thusand.,0
25,Subway Surfers,"Love the game however, it underperforms on my phone. Also, if you live in NYC, it lags and messes you up when you connect and disconnect from the internet/mobile network while in the subway (actually surfing). Otherwise, it's probably the best game to train your gaming input reaction. As the game gets faster and demands quicker inputs; you'll realize how valuable it is to cancel animations to manuever around the track. If you're a fighting game finatic, this works great as a complimentory MG.",1
26,Subway Surfers,"Overally a good game. Or it couls be good for some. It is too fast paced. The game often may end quickly. You can't play it chill. Ideally there should be different levels of pace for the different players. It is repetitive. Which includes also that you play on the same track, the same scenery and things. It could be developed further. It can be a very fun game for some players. For those who seek fast pace and reactions and might love the genre",1
27,Subway Surfers,"Very cool game, more intresting and addicting as you get better and you play more. Such as: Doing missions, completing awards, getting high scores and getting medals in Top Run. Also there are upgrades for powerups. It is a very simple game and as trains come to you have to dodge them. Every few weeks an update comes out and devs are very active and up to date with every update. I would totally recommend this never ending game. Its very fun! I hope you like the game and my review on this game",1
28,Minion Rush,"There are both pros and cons to the new version. I like the new version because it is easier to earn tokens. The old version didn't have as many lags. In the game, there is an ad that stops a second before it says it will stop (toy brick crush or something like that), making you either press it to go to the play store, or close minion rush and have to wait three minutes to get back in the game, and that ad usually pops up when you press ""watch ad to revive"". I will rate 5 stars when it is fixed.",1
29,Minion Rush,"this is a fun game, but when I try to use my tickets from an event, it decreases my amount and doesn't give me the item. Also, when I'm opening the prize pods, after 4 or 5, it won't play the video. I have to go out, close the app, and go back in. otherwise, it is a great game!",1
30,Minion Rush,I used to play this game all the time where you could just run for as long as you wanted to until you died. now there are these dumb missions that mess up literally everything. you're just playing and it stops and tells you that all the targets have been reached and it takes me out. why can't it be without missions????? why??????,0
31,Chess,I had a draw on the first and only game I played. The description said it is for any level but there's no tutorial. There are written instructions but they're useless when I'm in the game. I am uninstalling and looking for a game that has a tutorial for beginners. Otherwise this game is nice.,0
32,Chess,"good graphics, but whoever developed this didnt bother with following chess rules. theres many times where I've had the king in Checkmate and because the computer ran out of moves, it rules it as a draw. There are rules in Chess that govern draws and losses, and they didnt follow them very well. There have also been times that the game ended with me losing, even though I still had plenty of freedom to move. I give it 2 stars because of functionality.",1
33,Chess,"I like this app. however, I find that many times the computer makes moves that throws the game , making it easy for me to win. Sometimes the castle or the queen will move into a corner, and just move one space back and forth when it could clearly be attacking me. I think that this needs to be fixed in the program. Sometimes the computer will just give away a piece. For the most part the games are extremely challenging. I've learned some valuable strategy .",1
34,Clash of Clans,"I think and know this game is amazing, like who would come up with bomb wielding skeletons in an Air Balloon. you can battle online, single player, and you can build your own village however youd like, no interferences. You can also make your very own clan. It does have a few mishaps though, but very few, like the cost of the black elixir collector and how much space the wizards take up, but that's about it. This game is amazing overall and I hope you guys will enjoy it to!",1
35,Clash of Clans,"Back in 6th grade, I downloaded clash of clans, thinking it might be a fun game to play to pass time. Little did I know, clash of clans would help me through the toughest time of my life. When my grandma died, I was lost. I had lost hope on life and I began resorting to drugs like crack and eventually crystal meth. Then one day, my wizards upgraded to lvl 6 and my life changed. I started 3 staring bases, and I got hope. Hope that I could live without my grandma and stop doing crack. Thank you coc",1
36,Meena Game,This more tells about that what is right and what is wrong. It also advice us many things. For this app kids can learn different types of things that is pretty good. So all kids should play this.,0
37,Temple run 2,"it's decent... it has a lot of microtransactions, but after all, it IS a free game. it's actually well made and original, with minimal ads, goofy moments, and a lot of effort put into it. some of the stuff is impressive for a mobile game engine. it DOES have a lot of level grinding though... but not too much, like certain other games.",1
38,Word Cross,Hard game but good for mind power,1
39,Word Cross,Its fun an first placed. I m enjoying this very much,1
40,Word Cross,Its not what it says its not fun its boring,0
41,Mafia City,the game is good. but it only for people who are really up for spending big time. if you play without spending its very much frustrating because no matter how much you power up there are people who buy buffs and will come and make you zero in moments. you will end up being farm for other base where they will come and take all your loot i've been playing this game for a year now. i have to maintain 4 account just to keep up and upgrade my buildings to level 30 mansion which took me 9 months,0
42,Mafia City,I HATE these kind of games. Boring. Just here to get diamond offer. Way to long upgrading stuff or getting anywhere. Don't even know how to play yet but much more powerful clans can just blow everything up and suck resources dry before you even know how to return the gestures. Hope I can suffer through to 15 and uninstall this non action packed slow moving bore of a game soon.,0
43,Block Puzzle Legend,I really enjoy this type of game and this is one of the best of this type. I wish someone would make a mode where you can rotate the blocks (without the need for stars). Sort of like how it was in the old Tetris. Thank you for a great game.,1
44,Block Puzzle Legend,Time pass game no matter what ever graphics it's a game to be played starting I was not liking it I deleted 3 times n now I am getting use to this game so I kept it now I will not delete it.,1
45,Block Puzzle Legend,Thanks dear for your help with this matter is greatly appreciated I will be able to get a hold of hours to go I have his number and don't want me to send it again and again just to go over your head and I an not e it in the mail tomorrow morning at a little more about you want me the new one I will like I am going in a bit and get the rest in a bit to pick it again for we're excited with with with with you we ended the day I will like it in with me a a good BB hkrkrheoeirto the same kind regards,1
46,Zombie Tsunami,"Ads!! There are to many ads now, and when you watch the videos for free diamonds, 90% of the time you won't get them! Or if you die at the end of the game and watch a video, you still die. I spend more time watching videos then playing the game. And I've been playing and loving this games since it first came out years ago, but I'm sick of not getting diamonds after watching allll the videos. Wasting my time! Fix this now!!",0
47,Zombie Tsunami,"Frankly,, I'm getting a little sick of this game. The bird updates continue to just be more of the same bird again and again, instead of moving forward you just end up with 3 of the same bird - and its just getting on my nerves. There's no point in putting up with increasingly aggressive ads just to",0
48,Hill Climb Racing,Idk why people are hating on this game so much. I used to play it so much as a kid on car trips and it's a good game to pass the time. people claim to not know how to play it? it's rlly simple actually. Sure it doesn't really obey the laws of physics but that's what makes it a fun and interesting game.,1
49,Hill Climb Racing,bad game in the world i dont know the controlles and i dont know how to complete mission ,0
50,Hill Climb Racing,this game is becoming worst update by update . The vehicle's overall performance has been decreased. example The Monster Truck used to flip and black flip a lot in the highway track but now after the update it doesn't even go as fast as it used to go before. looks like the developer is decreasing the overall performance or strength of the vehicles didn't like it,0
51,Hill Climb Racing,"This game should be #1 on Google play Top charts! It's offline and addictive! I've unlocked all stages and almost all vehicles, having fully upgraded more than 10 vehicles, and built a few in 'garage' too! My only complain is about a must-have option which is unfortunately missing in this fantastic game : ""an option to revive and continue the game at least once in the end of every round by spending a few gems!""",1
52, Dhoom:3 The Game,"the controls are very poor! ! I request you not to download this game. after deleating this game my phone isn't working properly. I think this game has some kind of virus or that kind of stuff. personally I think it is no that bad. it just needs some improvements. I gave it 2 stars because it's not that bad. and also,99 games have done a bit hard work to make this game .try to make button controls please. try making more games with better controls.best of luck further!!!",0
53, Dhoom:3 The Game,if you need any help either way we should get together sometime and we can go over the house and we will see you we on for a few days but I will let you know know if I should be done with the house or anything like the y I will get it for the first time since I have a month and a half of my life with me kmi aa I have a few more days to go to the store to buy a new one but I'm not sure if I can make it it was a good day to come in and talk to you soon and have a good day at work,0
54,Traffic Tour,sorry to say but it is not a multiplayer game...you can find and fight with opponents even without internet connection once you connect game with internet(they still drives and control car like someone is driving it). This game is not providing what it claims so at least i cannot trust...uninstalling!,0
55,Traffic Tour,i rather experienced a fantastic game with excellent online features.The main problem is the unappropriate ads which keep on showing with some offensive content. if you could just solve this pop up ads problem as i myself is not mature enough to watch these kind of things. It will be your pleasure to resolve this problem so that icould fully enjoy this outstanding game with no interruptions.,0
56,Traffic Tour,"there's a mission where you have to go through a minefield of yellow tokens to find 5 green tokens... but because the tokens are transparent it's virtually impossible to do it, because the yellow & green tokens look the same until you're right up on them & by then it's too late. aside from that it's a solid game... but that 1 mission really spoils it for me.",1
57,Farming Simulator 14,"I love this game, I owned the game on Xbox One, before I sold the console, but that's besides the point, you've done really well with this game, almost identical to the console version, with the necessary changes to UI/HUD. The only thing I find irksome is knowing ones location when travelling, there's no way to tell which direction you are travelling, if I may make a suggestion to rectify this, top right hand corner, add a small compass which indicates the direction of travel.",1
58,Farming Simulator 14,"A fun and realistic farming game which teaches you how farming works. I like how you start with some basic machinery and paddocks to get you going and you upgrade and upscale as you make money from harvesting your crops. My only criticism is that after 91 hours of play I own the entire districts paddocks and meadows, several million dollars worth of machinery (where I can be working 6 paddocks at the same time) and 1.6 million dollars in the bank, so I have run out of goals to reach!",1
59,Farming Simulator 14,I really like this game. I had purchased the unlocks for the equipment and saved my progress after each purchase. The next day all the equipment was again locked. I emailed support three days ago and received no reply. I wish I could dispute the charges with google because I did not receive what was promised.,0
60,Sniper 3D Gun Shooter,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!Maybe wait till the reviews change. Game was decent before the latest update. Way too many bugs now and not worth spending any time or money on this. Almost like the deveolpers gave up on it. Customer service is non-existant right now. I've been playing this game for almost a year now. I have been a part of a few squads and know that quite a few people have cancelled their Premium subscriptions and quit the game entirely, because of this update.",0
61,Sniper 3D Gun Shooter,"PLEASE FIX THE CONNECTION ISSUE I CAN'T CONNECT TO PVP . Awesome game but after the last update I can't play PvP anymore. Developers don't care. I've invested my time and money in this game and I can't play. No one from Google play or the developers seem to care. I'm seriously considering to drop android in general. No one on my squad with an iPhone has an issue, I would give them NO STARS if I had that option. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME",0
62,Sniper 3D Gun Shooter,"Nice game play. Take a long time to earn upgrades unless you are willing to pay but doable. Offers of rebates on upgrades are always just above your available game funds forcing you to purchase more funds if you want to take advantage of the deal. But you can have lots of fun without having to purchase funds, you just need patience to watch some ads to get the energy to continue and earn funds for upgrades. In summary, it's a good game",1
63,Hit & Knock down,"would be better if it didnt take back to the beginning when no clear, or else reward better. or something. i relize it needs to be competitive but, hmmmm. why are the balls so bang expensive? Not all peeps are able to afford, and gold will not be used to advance. I would give more stars but, needs some work. I like the game, but, can be discouraging at the same time",0
64,Hit & Knock down,When I first started playing it was great. No ads. Then ads before game starts. That was ok. Now ads pop up in the middle of playing. That sucks. Uninstalling. Too bad. Otherwise good game. 2-2-19 tried again ad's worse than ever! make a pay for version you damn sellouts! 3-15-19=worse. ads intrusive and obscenely nasty and disgusting. No help after contacting creator. UNINSTALLING jerks!!!,0
65,Hit & Knock down,"This game is not only fun, but it can also teach you where to throw the ball and aim it just right so you can use as few balls as possible. Now, if I could only throw a ball as well using five fingers.",1
66,Cover Fire: action shooting games,"This game is really awesome and also very addictive. Graphics is amazing. But the problem occur when I choose the option of ""high"" graphics. In the medium graphics, the game runs smoothly and also with very good graphics but upon increasing the quality of graphics, the smoothness no longer exists and the quality of graphics also decreases. But, the game is awesome.",1
67,Cover Fire: action shooting games,"Great game a lot of fun. It is just really something to pass time and have a little fun. The missions are not all just easy and it really challenges you to get the 3 stars to complete the mission. AND ITS FREE, SOUNDS LIKE ME. Go download the app.",1
68,Cover Fire: action shooting games,No Events in several months now. It would seem that greed has taken over with the developers as there are too many 'watch this video' to progress links now. Used to be a lot of fun. Now it's the same thing every day.,0
69, Darkness Rises,"The game crashes way too much, even after the new update. It mostly happens in the middle of co-ops games, and returning back from the village.  Server problems in the middle of pvps, even after using a 100mbps connection, I get kicked out and can't play pvp for a while.",0
70, Darkness Rises,"It's a very immersive game! It has tons of content that leaves you with a lot of things to do, you can also create multiple characters if ever you wanna try something new. And the is also generous to its players, they give rewards for almost every single thing you do. They also update often and launch different kinds of events.",1
71, Darkness Rises,"Great game, it can be a little repetitive but all rpgs are. It's really generous with gold, energy, and rare equipment. The game even rewards you for taking breaks instead of non-stop grinding. The only things that I think need work are the PvP matchmaking, I have had more times than not where I'm being paired with a opponent that can one shot me. The other thing is that it takes a while to get upgrade stones (but there are probably other ways than the daily dungeon). Other than that, great game.",1
72,Escape Titanic,"Terrible... almost ANYTHING you click on is ad related somehow- click on this clue or this part of the puzzle? Oh! Random ad... how about getting those free hints by watching ads? Doesn't happen. Watched about 5 ads in a row and never got a free hint. P.S. The doors are the major ad trap. So simple, but it won't let you until you've bought it or watched a million ads...",0
73,Escape Titanic,"Not a bad game but there are way too many ads. I don't mind ads since I know it's a free game but every step there are 30 seconds ads? And the fact that its says watch videos for free hint but after watching 3 times, didn't even get a hint, feels like being cheated into watching.",0
74,Escape Titanic,"good puzzle solving fun, graphics are fun and the game is easy to navigate. it promoted me to early to be able to give an accurate review but so far so good and maybe ask players to rate after a few hours of active game time. possibly could have been five stars if you allowed adequate challenges to be completed ..",1
75,Benji Bananas,It's really amazing!! Full of fun and excitements to reach the next world!! It has amazing graphics!! The mouth of Benji after eating chilly looks very funny!! In all it is one of the best games of android in my eyes,1
76,Benji Bananas,"The game sucks.....the bananas and the monkey have not been objectified properly, however, the obstacles are extended beyond their outlines. Honestly, the game sucks and I highly advise you to not install it.",0
77,Benji Bananas,"Nice game. Those who are crying because of controls must learn how to master them, those who say that everytime you lose, the game starts over... For them, most of the acrade games start over. You can pay game currency to unlock the levels. Great game.",1
78,Lep's World 2,this game is so amazing but I have a problem I think I finished it and at another world is writing cooming soon so I don't know what to do I played those bonus level and I'm not sure to uninstall it because I want to play more.,1
79,Lep's World 2,wish it was harder. game controlls worked of course. definitely try it and unintall it if you want to.I thought this was a pretty awesome game overall. it was also like i said a pretty decent game to play. i of course do think that it should at least get three hearts in my opinion. but like i said again overall it was a great game to download.,1
80,Lep's World 2,"I've played so many games before,but this game was just so breath taking.I could reach heaven with this game (if it was possible.)I have no more words to describe this game.I can't wait to go to my new imaginary kingdom and discover awesome words and new adventures.",1
81,Grand Gangsters 3D,"Thanks for all of the Crown Estate, 2 to the Crown Estate, but it would have to pay the 8th, I think it's a great deal. The list of the most popular programs and I have to do it for the next day or two. I think I have been added. I think the best way of life and times of course the UK and then I will have the opportunity for an interview fora to you. If 7 the same 6th of July you 6 to you, but 14th, bit. It is not the same time as I have to pay for it",1
82,Grand Gangsters 3D,video wont play for free gold or money and also the daily reward wont work for about months now!!! im uninstalling til its fixed. which wont get fixed cause suck ass deveopers!!!! fix these issues and i will rate 10 stars. now its negative 10 stars,0
83,Grand Gangsters 3D,"Its really amazing, I have GTA SA, VC and III in my PC and I liked to play all of these games. And now, I can enjoy the same fun in my phone too! Its almost perfect, only problem is the textures (like buildings, traffic cars, peds etc) are load too slowly, which looks little unrealistic. But other than that its perfect! I rated it 5 stars!! Keep improving good job! ",1
84,Hard Time (Prison Sim),"very good! Very minimalistic concept done to the T. It's a very engaging experience for the player, and the insanity it brings makes it truly a HARD TIME. The Wrestling Engine used on this game makes NPC's easily agitated and aggresive, causing the experience to take an interesting turn when you accidently kill someone and go insane and lose control of your character. Overall, a pleasant experience",1
85,Hard Time (Prison Sim),"I need help, the game won't work. Whenever I go into a new room, items freak out in the upper left corner if the game, and there's no people, me, or controls on the screen. I tried forcing the game to stop, I tried restarting my phone, and I tried uninstalling and reinstalling. I love this game, but I really can't play it.",0
86,Hard Time (Prison Sim),"I like the game, been playing it for a while, I just wish that once the inmate was given the option to become an officer ... we had the same options as the officer and not treated like a inmate still, like we should be able to arrest inmates",1
87,Gangstar Vegas - mafia game,"this new update is WEIRD, theres no background music, and missing some of its background effect sound, also some vehicles had no engine sound, and the color is so bright esp in daytime that make my eyes sore, i'm actively playing this game on my android 6.0, and my note8 also had this same problem, my connection is good but theres no easter bunny, no street cred, only the gang event.",0
88,Gangstar Vegas - mafia game,Pls Read This. This is a awesome game But i think its gonna be more cool/awesome if we can coztumize our car and buying a house n coztumize it and we can play on online like meeting other players and play some minigames such as racing and etc. i seriously think this a good idea and i serously hope this is gonna be the biggest update. can you pls replay if you this a great idea,1
89,Gangstar Vegas - mafia game,This game is good but when I steal a luxury car there are too much police and can't sell the car and most of the time I have to quite the game and sometimes the watch an add option doesn't works so please fix this,1
90,Choices: Stories You Play,"Update: In one book you have to pay for clothes that are in your own suitcase. PLEASE DO NOT SPEND ANY REAL MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!!!You basically can't get anywhere without spending a LOT of actual money. Can't progress in skills or relationships. Can't get appropriate clothing to wear. Can't give your own twin sister a birthday gift. You can do NOTHING the ""tutorials"" urge you to do without it costing way more than an actual trip to the movies, a real book, or even an audio download of a book.",0
91,Choices: Stories You Play,"Fun game idea, but it's set up so that you have to spend a bunch of money in order to get anywhere in the stories. It takes far too long to earn keys and gems. You now get 2 gems for completing a chapter, but the game crashes 75% of the time when I'm trying to earn a gem by watching an ad. Update: Seriously, when is the issue with ads going to be fixed? It's probably lost me 40 gems at least. Seems awfully fishy at this point. Fix it or give us more gems! I hardly ever play anymore.",0
92,Choices: Stories You Play,"Don't get me wrong I enjoy the game. The ONE thing that is keeping my rating from 5 stars is the diamonds. I hate that I can't do choices I want to do because I don't have enough diamonds. I feel like the diamonds you get after a chapter increase. Also for the 3 hour thing, I think you should receive 3 - 5 diamonds. It sucks because I really enjoy the game but having to spend 2 dollars to only make 1 diamond choice. Especially when there can be 3 diamond choices in a chapter",0
93,Necropalace,"What an ugly game! The developer must be a psychopath. Oh Ha! Ha! Ha! A sarcastic reply. You know what, you are a funny man Chandler! A very funny man!! And a psychopath!!!",0
94,Necropalace,"A game with the full campaign available without pay. Wonderful. And a very nice story, cool game play, difficult but not too hard levels, .. Successful.",0
95,Cube Escape: Paradox,"Exellent! I am quite demanding when it comes to this kind of games and this certainly has everything I expect in a game! It's addictive and not too easy, yet not at all impossible if you put your brain working. Good gameplay too and quite an interesting story. So it's clear how much I love the game: usually, when it comes to phone games, I avoid spending money on any feature at all. But this game, it's so addictive and well made, I didn't even think twice about buying the second chapter.",1
96,Cube Escape: Paradox,"Certainly a head scratcher. I did have to use the walkthrough a few times for some of the puzzles, but it did keep me entertained. On a seperate note, with regards to another Rusty Lakes Game. Rusty Lakes Roots. I can't seem to leave a review for that game so I'll do it here. Quite enjoyable but a lot of the levels, particularly the last one, make no sense whatsoever! How people are supposed to work out some of these puzzles is beyond me.",1
97,Cube Escape: Paradox,"this is amazing. I watched the movie, then played the chapter, and bought chapter 2. I think I'm going to pay to play all of the other games by you guys that cost money after my paycheck. Chapter 2 of Paradox has convinced me i must play them ALL! I have to say as far as escape games, series games narratives, and mystery to a puzzle game goes, Cube Escape games are tied with the Submachine series as my all time favorite!",1
98,My Lovey : Choose your otome story,"regarding the recent update, you guys just made it harder to get coins rather than making it easier if not why would you adjust the gold in the mini game??? does not make sense first when I started playing in the hard level I used to receive 1500 after that adjusted the gold to 800 and now what 300??? this will just take forever I understand you guys would rather people purchasing these than getting them free but you're at least getting paid from the ads and videos that pop up in the mini game",0
99,My Lovey : Choose your otome story,"the sentences are broken, the back story makes no sense and the worst part is that the keys are used up so fast. 1 key is used for 1 ""chapter"" and I use that term lightly. the chapter is 2 sentences and they sometimes recap and then you only get 1 new line of story. and let's talk about the rubies. so basically if you the more romantic choices you have to pay rubies.... also know as real money. the story and characters aren't even worth any amount of money. this is a joke",0
100,My Lovey : Choose your otome story,"this was one of my favorite apps because I LOVED the Sharehouse story (specifically Haberu!!). I was also super super addicted to the fun MiniGame where you can win ""gold"" and would play it constantly and on my break at work. But the most recent update says the mini game is going away, and they are no longer giving keys at chapter completion. This sounds like a ploy to make it impossible to earn ""gold"" any other way than buying it. Which ruins the entire atmosphere I've gotten used to.",0
101,Lost Journey,"The way I prefer, this game is non-addictive which is very important these days. It has beautiful graphics, calming slow music, easy controls with challenging puzzling stages. Doesn't give you notifications or advertisements, it is a pleasant experience through and through. I recommend the game. Hardly lasts a week if you play half an hour to an hour on the weekdays.",1
102,Lost Journey,"Fun, Clever Puzzle Game w/ Chill Vibe. A platformer in which the hourglass button both flips the level vertically (upside down) and inverts the solid parts of the level. (Pressing button again reverses both of those effects). Strategically use this mechanic to get through the level. Simple controls, only 3 other buttons (left, right and jump). The artwork and music are lovely & soothing, so it feels peaceful to play, even as you're being challenged. Very enjoyable.",1
103,Lost Journey,"It's kinda fun, but can easily get boring most of the time. The huge negative is the character design. Why can't you develop your own characters? Why do you need so badly to copy other people's stuff? You will NEVER grow as a developer like this. Be original, do new stuff, be creative, don't try to copy famous games and studios.",0
104,Mini World: Block Art,"this is a great game with even way more items. in Minecraft there's just a few weapons and a load of blocks, mini world has even more weapons and more block's, and it's free, what annoys me is that you have to change to adventure mode to put on amor, a very good game, but i can't play with internet, because its always at only at 2 bars of internet",1
105,Mini World: Block Art,I love it. I hope the devs make more skin tones and character customization though. I don't want to be a little white dude and the only people of color are the enemy savages. other than that this game is awesome.,1
106,Mini World: Block Art,the game is very impressive! and the problem is the game had a little bit of laggy. please fix it at very smooth like minecraft. this game can beat minecraft i believe. And add some Mods like villages and peoples,1
107,Archery King,"original review is now deleted. UPDATE: After spending close to $100 dollars for upgrades and packages all seemed to go well... for about a week. I went from around 40million in gold to 3 million within a few days. Literally the easiest of targets don't register correctly, and the amount of bots and cheaters clean you out of your gold every time. This game used to be great and now it is a major disappointment. I see other reviews having the same issues. I'm tire of the bull, so I'm deleting..",0
108,Archery King,"Great game. awesome gameplay, realistic and fun. Has a huge variety of in game options, upgrades. Provides a few different game types, rush, standard, bingo, and a story type mode(available offline). Each with multiple difficulties. Rush and Standard mode have special events which provide a variety of different target types. overall very entertaining app. Must have!!!!",1
109,Archery King,the bots win all the time. better bow means nothing. when the time is up it still counts the others shot. when the opposite guy only has 3 arrows shot he has 50 points!!?? how does that work. if I'm beating someone by 20 how does he all the sudden beat me by 20 in the matter of 3 shots. this game is bull.,0
110,King's Empire,"I would give it five stars if the support was better. I will say they are trying. Been playing since 2012. You can ghost the account and go back but be sure to ask for help. Not support help, ask other players. If you leave the game unprotected you will lose everything you built. It's a good game to play on the bus, train or on a break. You can leave it quickly and go back.. It's fun. Many say it's expensive. It's not. You don't have to buy anything. You can win gems for items",1
111,Shadowverse CCG,Amazing game. The rules are really simple and easy to go along with and the animations are top notch. If I was to criticise one thing it would be the lack of trading. The major problem with trading in this game could be the massive farming everyone would obviously take advantage of. I think if you were to set it up so that cards of value can only be traded with other cards of the same value. Like legendaries can only be traded with another legendary that could fix that problem.,1
112,Shadowverse CCG,"I have played a couple of TCG's before Shadowverse but this one is just way better. Lovely Artworks, simple Controls, nice mechanics. Furthermore you don't have to sell your soul in order to obtain new cards or ingame money. There are plenty possibilities to earn money. Playing the story, absolving quests, playing against bots, doing challenges (Take Two) participate on events (Cups). Beside that you get other free stuff just by playing aswell like Cardbacks. 10/10 would recommend.",1
113,Shadowverse CCG,As a returning player who has been playing this game consecutively for 2 months im happy to say that im happy that this game was worth jumping back into. the rerolling option is awsome if your unhappy with your pulls and also FREE 50 PACKS yes thats right that is something you never see in a tcg mobile game and free rerolls to hopefully craft your first deck. Overall a fun casual game with amazing art and would recommend anyone who is eyeing this game to jump in.,1
114,Alice in the Mirrors of Albion,"Edit Update: Now every building's games are on a timer. I'm looking for a new game.... Edit: I have changed my review to one star. If i could, I would probably switch it to less than one star. With this new update, I can no longer watch videos to either make the clown laugh or to earn points to play with. I was already frustrated with the amount of time it took to refresh levels. This had become my favorite game. Not anymore.",0
115,Alice in the Mirrors of Albion,"So Frustrated. I can no longer watch videos to gain additional hits on enemies on patrol, gain energy, spin the wheel, or attack the bosses. I used to play every day, but now I'm just frustrated constantly because I can't do anything or gain any bonuses. The graphics are wonderful and the game is challenging which is why i enjoyed it so much. But now I'm more irritated than anything else",0
116,Alice in the Mirrors of Albion,Initially this was a super fun game. However now you can no longer watch ad videos to deal damage or get bonuses. I'm not adverse to buying a few things here and there to support the game but in order to play you'd have to spend a fortune. Graphics and gameplay are beautiful but the time it takes to get more energy and the fact that I was unable to move past a level for over a week because I couldn't watch a video to deal damage and had to rely of gifts from friends is very frustrating.,0
117,My Talking Angela,I have an amazon fire tablet and the game would crash for no reason,0
118,My Talking Angela,it drives me crazy trying to click the x on the ads that pop up every 5 seconds. i don't have this problem with any other app but i know i click directly on the x and it still sends me to the app store almost 10 times before it finally registers that ive been trying to exit the ad. this game is meant for children and even as an adult playing this i have this problem. imagine all the purchases a kid might make on accident.,1
119,My Talking Angela,well for my experience in my talking angela i liked the cool games that you can play on the game.it was well prepared and presented. When beginners play it like little kids it would suit them more often. Well absuletly older children can play it as well but I prefer the younger children should be able to play a proper kids game to make them have enery and to have fun with their friends and being able to listen to the intrusions and to enjoy their young childhoods,1
120,My Talking Angela,"when you spin wheel all you ever get is small , Mostly one diamond.OMG!!! spin wheel one diamond one food ; ONE Everything . At Least Once a month it would Be Nice to get More of something!!! now I'm in a middle of a game & screen goes black I have to start back up plus lose my coins from game. I REALLY ENJOY the game;I Love talking Angela ; I Really HOPE it gets fixed. Thank You",1
121,Township,Love playing but for some reason I have had township cash disappear several times. I also reinstalled the game as I was unable to visit some my friends because the have a more current version??? I don't know where else there would be one. Hooray found it a few days after this post. 3/22/19 New makevoer is nice. Easier to distinguish buildings etc.,1
122,Township,"The images are colourful,engaging & creative.It gets you involved in selling, buying, producing, and decision-making in exciting ways. It gives you the opportunity to extend your wildest artistic imagination and allows changes at your pleasure. Many opportunities to access merchandise are at your finger-tips. A variety of game interactions and rewards make it hard to stop. You're rewarded with coins, town cash, jewels etc. for everything you do.",1
123,Township,"Thanks to developers, I'd sent a problem ticket, they took care of it very quickly. I love this game, it was my son's favourite. Was changing devices and didn't want to lose all my program. So thanks very much for update. The only bit remaining, is to prevent the list of friends requiring help, not to reset to Ernie but stay on last visited. Cheers!",1
124,Township,"only for who willing to spend bucks for anything. kept on asking for money for almost anything!!! should let players enjoy the game. u will never able to play a satisfying game at all as it is building a town, obviously will take u very long to see outcomes but while that u will get a mind torture to find money where you need to pay via google acc. makes you feel very bad. this game is a gold digger",0
125,Cooking Fever,"This app is alright but the money asked for upgrades is too much. I can't even buy a restaurant. I had a restaurant already and I can't upgrade it. So the customers who come are really disappointed. Now I am in the list of ""disappointed persons"". If you don't check this out, I will simply uninstall this app. Now I have a new restarted version.",0
126,Cooking Fever,"Really fun and addicting game. I love all the upgrades you can get and the prices for everything are fair. I recently got 5000 coins for downloading nordcurrent's other app and that helped me boost my restaurant a lot. My only complaint is that, I had 12 diamonds when this thing popped up for the machine that cooks the burgers and sausages. I've had it before and it was very helpful, so I decided to unlock it for 10 diamonds. It took my diamonds away but I dont have the machine.",1
127,Cooking Fever,robbery!!!! I have spent so much money on this game I got a new phone so I login in to my Google account as I was told and the coins I JUST purchased and level I just completed was not even on the game. I contacted customers service and was told to login the same account. like I didn't do that to begin with. A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!!!,0
128,Bike Racing 2018,the worst game it hangs so much and if we want anything we have to pay for it nothing is free quality is not good at all pls if you don't know how to make games then pls don't make them and also don't bother or irritate us its a request and improve your games if you want people to download your games,0
129,Bike Racing 2018,very very very very very wrost game this is. very bad controller. don't download this game. please please please don't download this game wrost game to play. I am in the first position but it took up me to you were knocked out .,0

131,Racing Fever:Moto,magnificent game. great dynamics and easy to use. graphics are decent as well as progress. thanks for making an awesome game,1
132,Racing Fever:Moto,"The game is good. The controls are easy and precise, the opponents are fair abd graphics are good. The only downside is the price of the bikes. Although you can put the money together by watching the ads, I think some bikes are too expensive (plus the H2R is not the fatest bike.",1
133,Racing Fever:Moto,"Worst game ever. There were no new routes. However, the bikes were cool, the customisation was good but still new routes should be there.",0
134,Dr. Driving 2,"This is a amazing app! It has improved alot since their last game Dr. Driving 1. In the first Dr. Driving it didnt let me change the cars, but in this one, it has many different options! It also has better graphics, their first game had more of a blocky graphic type of thing. This also has a more smooth type of graphics. They had added new tracks which im very happy about! They added more things such as challenges, levels, prizes and upgrades! The Controls are the same. I definitely recommend!",1
135,Dr. Driving 2,"really good game with a lot of different things to do. It also has a limit over how much u play it, so that we dont get too addicted to it like other games. I feel I'm getting the confidence to drive now. I wish we could get more petrol to play a bit more though. Otherwise I don't think I can think of anything else to improve the game. It is already good.",1
136,Dr. Driving 2,It is funfastic. I like it and rating it with five stars. Cars and graphics are supreme. I am feeling dificulty to finish the Slolam Test stage of chapter 3. But I am confident for success. I suggest the developers to make it permanent fuel and update the Tilt mode of steering. Thank you ,1
137,Badminton League,"This game is the best badminton game ever played. Please add more equips, things for costomizing my player, and please make it into 10 scores for 1set so that it will be more challenging. I will only give 5 stars if this improvement is seen in the next update",1
138,Badminton League,"Excellent Game !!! Can have more fun playing , Rules , Shots everything is realistic , To improve : 1. Add friends should be like 8Ball Pool, to add them Unique id etc, Not by wifi or Bluetooth . 2. Should vfx and etc , Please work on that !! amazing gaming app. keep it up !",1
139,Badminton League,This is the best game I have ever played . The only problem is that it is too addictive . I downloaded it in my exams and I played it all the time due to which I got less marks . But anyways it is the BEST GAME I have ever played.,1

143,Star Wars,"Over the past 5 years EA has systematically destroyed something I loved. This game in NOT free to play. It revolves solely around purchasing content to be remotely competitive. The time investment required for any sense of achievement is so rediculously unbalanced it isn't remotely enjoyable. So if you have a social life, relationships and money, don't install this game. You probably won't have them if the invest in this EA money grab ""game""... If I could ask for my time and money back, I would.",0
144,Star Wars,"Rat Race! This used to be the best game I had. all the characters and teams used to be balanced, which is what made it fun. Now they release new characters constantly and each group is more powerful than the last. of course you can farm these new characters, but it takes a while or you can spend real money and be competitive. another great game ruined by greed. i wouldn't bother starting to play it now, you already missed the good old days! ***And now, can't log in!",0
145,Star Wars,"Fun, challenging, and rewarding! With staple rpg mechanics, and great characters we all know and love, hard to let this go with any less than five stars. The only flaw, and honestly not necessarily a flaw, are the graphics. A bit outdated in textures, and overall graphical quality. However It is more than made up for with quality gameplay, and satisfying rewards.",1
146,Homescapes,Have yet to do the type of puzzles shown in the trailer. Really fun to design the home and follow the story. Games are difficult but persist. You will get better and the game seems to adjust to help you move along after a while. I wouldn't mind if things moved along a little faster and there were more choices in decorations and colors.,1
147,Homescapes,"Great start to the game - fun puzzles and a good storyline. HOWEVER, the 5 lives and taking 20 minutes to recover one is a joke. People wont pay the high prices, but if you let them watch adverts they'll play for longer and you'll make more money. Game has great potential, but stop trying to money grab - it has the opposite effect. Let the money come to you witu a great game.",0
148,Homescapes,"Really like this game. Unfortunately, certain levels are designed so that you either need a huge stroke of luck or need to purchase additional coins. I have no issue buying extra coins here and there. I understand the creators have to pay employees somehow",0
149,Real Bike Racing,This is the worst bike racing game in the universe. you have made a meal of bike racing. Utter poop. I know dog poop is better than this game. It has thousands of glitches and navigating the bike is a big problem. hate this game. let it die in hell ,0
150,Real Bike Racing,The idea of the game seems pretty good. Graphics and controls were a problem for me though so a change for the better in that would be pretty great for the game. I think the length of the races should also increase and more interesting stuff added. Overall though the game has a lot of potential!,0
151,Real Bike Racing,Its a good game but why the time limmit so less? Not enough time to pass the checking point. I'm not sure that my friends (people that playing this game) enough time or not but i just want to say please give extra time to pass the checking point. Tq so much. I just want to say these all.,1
152,World Soccer League,The gameplay is alright. The only problems are the lack of controls. Please add a separate sprint button. It's hard to maneuver the ball when constantly sprinting using the directional pad. Also please fix the delay,0
153,World Soccer League,"This game is by far the best android soccer game, why? Because it doesn't need internet connection, best graphic, simple to play and don't have to buy at all. I've downloaded countless soccer game, while other games try to extort money for some stupid creation, it promotes entertainment and usefulness of android mobile",1
154,World Soccer League,"I like that game. The graphics are awsome. You even get to choose your own level of difficulty. All the teams except yours their defence,attack, midfield and protection of the ball is poor.",1
155,Bubble Shooter,I enjoy this game but I don't want to play the same level weeks before I can finally beat it. why does it have to be so uninteresting anymore. it becomes very frustrating when you cannot beat a level. I like the challenge but even with getting three extra balls and then getting to watch a video you can't win this level. It's boring me to death now,0
156,Bubble Shooter," had over 900 coins they just disappeared, i didn't change the phone or even uninstall the app, and every once in a while it steals my coins again without any reason, I'm saving them for the harder level and it simply stole them, it sucks! Issue solved very quickly, great service ",0
157,Bubble Shooter,Even though I have shoot all the bubbles then also it is asking me to replay level 6. I have consumed the coins more than 3 times but still no improvement. Getting pathetic response. Also the adds shown contain offensive content sometimes. Please note this is played by kids and the ads should be appropriate.,0
158,Basketball Stars,"The game started off great but after a week it has gone downhill! My shots are ""blocked"" when the ball is at the net and I cannot redeem any free gifts. It lets me open 1 at best then tells me no videos available. I had no issues until I paid for the app. I have emailed asking for a refund. If the issue gets resolved I'll match it to the review.",1
159,Basketball Stars,It is very Interesting game.Its attacker defender mode is too interesting.It is unique than other basketball games.I like playing basketball and I am a national level basketball player. I often goes to play basketball in different areas. The graphics of this game are also very good. I also want to give them all five stars. At last I want to say that I like this game a lot and I want you to please play this game only once because I think you should also like this game. Thank you.,1
160,Basketball Stars,redownloaded after months of not playing. shooting system for all modes has gotten better and less laggier. another thing that changed and is bugging me is the uselessness of cash... I used to be able to win cash and use it to buy items like tops bottoms and balls... now I have a useless worthless amount of cash because I'm not even able to redeem it for anything. what is the point of winning cash ?,0
161,FIFA Soccer,"The graphics and the control seems ok to me. But it is rather laggy. I suggest you guys optimize this game so it wouldn't be that laggy. Especially for 1GB RAM devices please optimize it for low-end devices. Cause in my opinion, others will not complain about the graphics or the control if you fix the lagging issues. Overall it is a great game, I recommend it.",1
162,FIFA Soccer,"Include top scorers rank such that a player is awarded a golden boot at the end of each season or/and tournament. otherwise this game made it hard for me to play other games on my phone.

163,FIFA Soccer,"This game is terrible. I don't know what's worse, the graphics or the players themselves. There's no vibe about it, is boring. Dream League is better than this, and I tell you that game is also not great but I'd rather play it than this. Horrible, really horrible. ",0
164,Zombie Catchers,"The update had removed some of my progress. I had 100+ zombies saved, including bosses, and I when I loaded up the game, I only had 6 zombies between 2 types. As disheartening as that is, they also reduced the in game earning potential, heavily merging a lot of profit from specific products, slowing down an already slow game. I can't bring myself to play anymore because of this, it's just too disappointing.",0
165,Zombie Catchers,Very fun and enjoyable. a great game that you get to build your own store. I would rate it higher if you could actually contact them. no consumer support or help. like it glitches really hard at times where it won't let you move your guy. in turns it made me lose a handful of times and making me wonder if I should delete.... good game but could be better,0
166,Zombie Catchers,"Really love this game. Just have one real issue. The spear point sometimes catches on the edges of the buildings in the china town episode which caused me to not be able to chase the boss. It also catches in the drop down areas on the beach scenes and snow scenes and gets stuck. It doesnt clear until the scene chase is over which is a waste of time and loss of weapons. Do you have a fix for this? Is annoying. Also , how long before new episodes?",1

173,Jigsaw Puzzle,Often times a piece that's in the correct place won't register in the system and you have to play around with it in order for it to finally fit. The puzzles aren't really that challenging and even in the hardest mode possible the puzzles are quite easy. Ads are all over the place and the way the game is set up in general is quite awkward. I don't recommend.,0
174,Jigsaw Puzzle,so much of adds while playing game .which makes it disgusting to play .really disappointed by the adds while playing. so uninstalling it .,0
175,Jigsaw Puzzle,very boring.Dont irritate people with all this ads.You deserve only these many stars.I would like to give u no stars if that was possible.,0
176,Pokemon Go,"I'm having so much fun! I try to be an active person, but I frequently make excuses to 'take a shortcut' or 'take a walk later'.

178,Pokemon Go,"Great game. Its a shame I live in a quiet town and I have no friends that play, as I cannot participate in 4 or 5 star raids with any chance of winning. Also, if you're signed in with Pokmon Trainer Club, link your Google account in the settings and sign in that way, as the PTC would annoyingly sign me out a couple of times an hour, even during gameplay for jo apparent reason",1

Now all of a sudden the game has changed.I've been playng this for 2days. I can't seem to even reach 20,000. I will be going along just fine with many spaces to fill and it will pop up with 3 symbols that can't be used and knock me out. It does it everytime. It's like it fixed so you can't win. ? Why, there is no financial benefit. I'm going to drop out if it can't be",1
191,Block puzzel,"Game was doing OK, heading for 5 stars, when it showed a seriously inappropriate ad. Bad enough if I had been playing, but I wasn't. My 5YO granddaughter was playing when an ad, basically for mature prostitutes, came up. Lucky she was sat next to me, I grabbed the phone and she didn't realise what had come up on screen. So, if your thing is mature slappers who apparentlyime a lay and always say yes, this is the game to get that ad. Or Google. No doubt its quicker.",0
192,Block puzzel,"This Classic Block Puzzle is VERY good, but the people behind this game need to be more knowledgeable about which promotional apps, etc. will potentially harm one's Smart Phone with viruses.

193,Tetra classic,"I really like this app! I've been looking for a new Tetris app since the last one I used disappeared from the store and this one is almost perfect. My only problem with it is the touch controls, as I tend to mess up more as I go up the levels and can't be as precise with my moves. If possible I'd like to suggest adding an option for on screen button controls maybe? Otherwise, excellent app keep up the great work!",1
194,Tetra classic,"The best tetromino-stacking app I've encountered, and lightweight as Tetris should be. My one complaint is that it doesn't seem to have the unique piece order generator that Tetris should have: in actual Tetris, a randomly-ordered set of all seven pieces is generated and given to the player, then this is repeated, meaning no piece will go unseen for more than 12 pieces.",1
195,Tetra classic,"pretty good touchscreen controlled tetris clone. my biggest problem with it is that there doesnt seem to be a score, just a line count, so getting a Tetris is pointless, eliminating a large risk/reward element of the game. another minor problem is the way the falling blocks stop too quickly after hitting the block below it, in other tetris games you get a split-second to move the block before it 'sticks'. this gets frustrating when the blocks are near the top of the screen",0
196,Pop cat,"It's a very nice game and the graphics are great with the cute cats. But it gets quite hard after a while and it's not that easy to get coins for boosters for free.. I wish better options were available without money, I would be able to play the game for longer.",1

202,Fruit brust,the game is fun i've finished it twice already an downloaded it again and i actually like the upgrade my only problem is that it has to end it should be a game that keeps on going and gets harder an more challenging but for me its the best game on play store this is my 3rd time playing it from the start,1
203,Aces spades,"The game functions well. The various players are not all equal. Some are good, others are ok and a couple really suck - at tge hardest setting. I'd like for the players to be better.

This app is really awesome but very slow. need to make more faster in next version. another more things when already done double redouble then anybody can't play single hand. but in this app can play single hand after called double and redouble. it's totally wrong. I hope next version will be more faster and solve some wrong. thank you very much for make this app.,1
206,29 card games,the online playing version is too poor. there is no option to add a player to friend list if u like him .. player can leave anytime because he / she would have nothing to loose. i think the app builders haven't developed this game since they have built it.. if ludo star can have so much user friendly environment why won't this app have.. looking forward to a update which would resolve this issues .and best of luck guys u did a great job.. and i wish the new update would let me to edit my reviw,0

224,Card game 29,AI of this game is of noob level... it's for beginners... and you're partner is the dumbest... all card games on playstore are so dumb... when partner can skip weak cards on pointless cards bot uses colour and next card bot uses that weak card. sometimes it doesn't give you point card holds it up-to last and giving it to opponents... when you have a Jack of certain colour and opponents are using decks card on that particular colour partner will use the same colour making you loose your jack.,0
225,Spades,"Algorithm decides way to many games. Game awards or deducts points for 2nd, 3rd and 4th, so instead of playing to win, many players give points to high hand so they can come in 2nd or 3rd, thus scoring better. I played well enough to get a 100 rating, then came in last 13 games in a row, lowering my rating back down to 61. Your rating has nothing to do with how well you play or your skill level, it's decided by the aforementioned algorithm and the players playing for third.",0

Unfortunately the advertisements are particularly intrusive and anoying, I would happily pay a fee to remove the adverts if I could find an option to do so.

230,Euchre,"Great visuals and gameplay but no other way to put it, it cheats. Too many times the computer plays odd cards and the only reason that would happen is if it knew everyone elses cards.

Wish i wouldn't have wasted my money.",0
231,Canasta,"I still play this game despite the fact that the computer partner is programmed to do one thing, and that is to go out. No. Matter. What. So it can be frustrating when your partner throws away cards you are building a canasta for and frequently give away a frozen deck. Cursed thing! When I play, I view it as playing against three others and it is nice when your partner is actually helpful.",1
232,Seep,very bad mister who ever it may be. how could you allow computer to play on your behalf. it already knows all player cards. when player is not able to decide about cards put penalty. but not allow Computer to play on players behalf. very very poor maintained app doesn't know how integrate. please please do not waste your time and your data.,0
233,CSR Racing 2,"I love car games and this one is very addicting. It allows you to do everything you can possibly imagine when dealing with automobiles. You can upgrade your vehicle to the best of your ability and once you have your vehicle upgraded to your liking, hit the road and make some money racing other crews. You can even win and purchase automobiles. Like i said, very addicting. There's no car game quite like it! Hey, what more can I add to this, I think I've said it all in my very first rating.",1
234,CSR Racing 2,"The game crashes constantly, I've lost thousands of dollars and gas because, its auto lose. Can't customize cars at all other than really tacky paint schemes. Pricing for things are ridiculous. The loading between races and garage etc makes me want to jump off a bridge.",0

I do sometimes, I want to support the games , but its not maddening or prohibitive. Edit: I've taken a star back for lagginess at some points that always causes battles to go favor of enemy.

239,Super Bino Go ,I didn't like the game. The jump and fire buttons are located inconveniently. The colour is green as the scenery colour and the buttons are blurry. The landscape is rather poor.,0

Probably gonna delete it. i love a challenge, but not fair when the boards are all timed. impossible to beat with 30 seconds and you got to make 50 dishes. Edit: if i could give this game NO stars, I would. The repeatedly timed boards are not fair and there is WAY to MANY. JUST GREED LIKE ALL THE GAMES.",0
243,Ludo Club,great game but instead of typing all the time you should add in a voice caller to talk to you friends time runs out so fast that I can't even type properly but otherwise great game overall.

Also I have a lot of cash and can't use it can you add an update to at least buy chat packs/stickers and even design pawns with the cash.,1
244,Ludo Club,"It really sucks. I have tried giving this game a chance, however, it seems as if you only allow certain people a chance to succeed in this game. I will be deleting this game for good. I went ahead to give this game a chance, however, it is and still does only allow certain people to win.

245,Checkers,The game is fantastic. I actually really wanted to learn how to play checkers but I can't but through this awesome game now I can play checkers with my friends and relatives. Only one thing I do not like about the game is when I have a chance to out the computer so it forces me to move that circle so I can win but the computer strikes me back just and it is all bcz of of the game.So plz fix it. Hope you got my point. Otherwise the game rocks DO DOWNLOAD IT,1
246,Checkers,i never played the game but all your guyses texts make me want to play so i am going for my dream and play it. at first my brother carlos (i am not handing out any information of my life or self)was playing it and i had not a lot if games in my phone . so i was waching him play the game.he said i should get it so i you know went for my dream.,1

252,Sudoku Free,"I like this app compared to some similar because it usually tells you why it removes a candidate (hidden,crosshatch,etc.) On the down side sometimes it ignores some logic to go strait for a kill shot ( ie: this square is 5, but we cant say exactly why) , for instance I had to clear the candidates from a locked/hidden triple for it, as well as manually enter a hidden single it was ignoring. Other than that its a fairly nice app.",1
253,Sudoku Free,"Google play store removed this for a while there and wouldn't let me open the app on my phone which made me super disappointed and I tried other sudoku apps but they just weren't as good as this, so glad it's back on the play store, also glad I logged in, it still has my old data from before",1

Add more shapes and this game would be lots of fun.",0

275,WGT Golf,"A absolute must for persons who like the real feeling of golf. The online option is quick and responsive and very fun to play. Even playing alone on different courses is entertaining. Having the option to dress your character to give bonuses and skills, to buying better different clubs and balls. Also to be able to upgrade your skills, makes it a very unique way of playing golf with many options...Very addictive game.",1
276,WGT Golf,"pretty awesome game! the biggest takeaway is the putting, chipping, and club selection. they are super tough and the grid becomes more confusing than anything else. also, you don't have the ability to upgrade clubs unless you buy them with actual money. that's retarded. how do you expect me to enjoy the game playing a level 41 course when my driver barely reaches the fairway?? in my opinion all the MK clubs should be buyable for silver coins and remain in tour bag and not expire.",1
277,Word Swipe,"nice game i like it game it was very wonderful ang gorgeous l really really really like them my favourite game in the all games it was very difficult and easy thank you ,??????????????????????????i love love love this game",1
278,Word Swipe,"Uninstalling because the game that is advertised is not the game you get when you download. Also, after you win a level you don't get your reward unless you watch the ads. Some ads are okay, this is overkill.",0
279,Word Swipe,"Wonderful & loving the categories! Spelling was my favorite subject in grade school, so I'm going to loose alot of sleep ??playing this game late at night ??.",1
280,Real Guitar,Wow that is a very good one for me too and I hope you are doing well and I hope you are doing well and I hope you are doing well and I hope you are doing well too so far and I hope you are having fun in a couple places in New Jersey you have had some good friends in Colorado that I am not a fan at this weekend so you may want me too soon and not be so much better for the holidays than the rest on my blog for the most beautiful thing ever happened and it will take forever and will never ever make,1
281,Real Guitar,thanks for making me have fun with your games I have to be there by I have a few more things have no idea where I was and am not sure what to do at this time we are I can come in at the office at the moment and I have a meeting in I will be there for the meeting on Monday or I can just have no idea where it is but have a good day today and have no idea what was going on and what else do we want I have to get my hair I have to be there by I can come in tomorrow morning to pick up my car from home,1
282,Real Guitar,"very very bad app. the app is not free you will pay 217 ruppes per week. the app is not free . fake app do not download this app. he will waste you time , data , money .",0
283,Piano Games,"This game has peaceful songs and other types of songs that I enjoy. It gives me a great pleasure to say that this game gave its entire heart that fills me with determination with love of all kind. As I play this game, there's no better way to say that this is the one time I have ever enjoyed music as much as my sister does. With all the hard work you guys did, you made us felt happier than anyother can make us happy and smile. Keep it up and stay gold.",1
284,Piano Games,An absoloutly amazing game! I play the piano so it is very usefull. I got very good at it straight away! I hope this game gets 1billion downloads because its easy and super fun! Its just the perfect game if you dont have a piano so i hope you like it!,1
285,Piano Games,"i really like this game but today when i opened it, it only showed one song instead of all the songs i bought. it also reset my points thing. and reset my gems. Im upset cause i had a lot of gems more than 600 and they all disappered, all my rankings on the songs too! So the game reseted for me for some reason",0
286,Bead 16 (Sholo Guti),One star ratting is only for your new version. I was uninstalled your app but now i'm installing it again for few days and hope that you will be update it.,0
287,Bead 16 (Sholo Guti),"Super game beautiful sense game , but sometimes this apps distrab in the middle of game.its like( hang, stopped ,atomatic moving ,and some people kill without option like hacker..!!!! so I want update it as soon as possible",1
288,Extreme Car Driving,"this is the best game ever. for me it is a 5 star game. I love to play especially in the airport. good job bro. and yes can you help me with a favour? can you help me making a game, we both can make together. please bro, I have given you 5 stars and you won't help me? actually I guess I should not force you. but bro you are the best in making games. keep it up and any help then I will help you. best of luck to your future. May God Bless You. yeah I really love the game that much you know. bye",1
289,Extreme Car Driving,its good but i think u should like make the player a spy and our mission is to eliminate all criminals and we use the car as a spy car,1
290,Extreme Car Driving,"I really like this game. The controls and graphics are very smooth for a driving game on a mobile device. I don't really mind when you have to watch an ad to paint your car, but I would recommend an update for less frequent ads. I totally understand if you can't get this update, because like every mobile game has ads (I'm not braging). I don't really like how you go crazy fast and you get frequent dents on your car, but I love that you can fix your car with a push of a button.",1
291,Homescapes,Have yet to do the type of puzzles shown in the trailer. Really fun to design the home and follow the story. Games are difficult but persist. You will get better and the game seems to adjust to help you move along after a while. I wouldn't mind if things moved along a little faster and there were more choices in decorations and colors.,1
292,Homescapes,"puzzles should at least allow bombs ,colored balls and planes to explode when you get one on your last move to zero. that may make the last piece needed to win. that would be a surprise win and make it more exciting when you have done that same puzzle for a week. not a bad game but can be frustrating",0
293,Homescapes,This is another bejeweled game that makes you go through fifty billion rounds to get to the actual game they advertise! This is pure bait and switch! Uninstalling!,0
294,Shadow Fight 2,"This latest update has introduced glitches and reduced my performance significantly! This sucks. If It's not fixed soon, I'll just delete this gane, as I did with Shadow Fight 3. SF3 rewuired internet all the time, and now this one requires my PERSONAL INFORMARION!! That's unacceptable. I'm deleting the game now, in fact. This is what happens when greed takes control of a company's priorities.",0
295,Shadow Fight 2,"I found this game big fun especially after getting comfortable with the game play and controls. One annoyance is the monetary model used here. It's so hard to progress if u don't purchase currency such as coins. I'm still stuck on the first level because the Boss is too strong and gaining Coins is taking forever. Apart from that, this game could be a classic.",1
296,Shadow Fight 2,First of all thank you for removing the glitches from the previous version. After the update it is taking too long to load and the opponents movements and attacks have become too fast ! You seriously need to consider that so that i wont delete it and i will give it 5 stars. been playing it for 6 months dont make me regret it. Thank you,1
297,Hungry Shark Evolution,"It's a fun game but it has WAY too many ads. And to top it off, the ads are unskipable. You get an ad after each run. And every time it shows an ad, the sound turns off and I have to go into the settings and press the sound on/off button three times for the sound to come back on. Also, you place diamond fish in the environment more frequently.",0
298,Hungry Shark Evolution,"The game's graphic is beautiful, the shark models are cool too but there are some glitch I don't like, such as the ship has the cable that attaches with the diver cage sometimes like a ghost ship, suddenly appear and disappear, and it is also lagged on the water surface too. Another glitch is when I control the shark, the lagged cable from that ship pull and take my shark go to a far and different place in the sea and I can't control my shark anymore, so it will die soon (like the shark was just teleported). Finally, the game is not smooth enough to have a best experiences.",1
299,Hungry Shark Evolution,"After a year or more of playing the game has become unstable . My purchase of the shamrock pact never downloaded the shamrock and 20 diamonds , just took my 1.99 and the game is freezing up and not saving the diamonds I'm earning in the game . I've cleared the cache and it still is unstable . I've contacted support twice and no response at all .",0
300,Happy Glass,"What a cute game. The music is charming. It's simple yet you have to pay attention to detail. I like the smiley cup. I thought the way this game dealt with ads at first was very tasteful until big ads played after finishing a level. I know ads are there to generate money to pay for things and make some profit but it's frustrating when it's so overboard like that. Also, the video ads freeze about 3/4 in and I have to restart the app. Happened multiple times. Something to look into.",1
301,Happy Glass,"good game , only problem is too many ads and slow sometimes. For some reason ocasionlly the hints don't work and the game keeps giving the same hint until it works. I probally would not get the game if it was expensive. Overall the puzzles are cool and its a fun game. Definetly a keeper for me despite the few bugs. Although the game""Love Balls""is pretty cool too. Would be a great game for all you puzzle lovers. I also understand the need for ads . Great game keep the games coming. Love the game.",1
302,Happy Glass,"You need coins for failed challenge attempts. If you actively go for the free ones, you will watch 30 seconds of ads for every 5 seconds of play. There are MUCH better time killers out there. And another problem, your finger is the stylus to draw the line. In some puzzles, the area you need to draw is VERY small. And guess what, you can't see it because your finger is covering that part of the screen.",0
303,Helix Jump,"The game is made to steal information from the user... I mean they put it in the game. The game is not pollished and lags on a very good phone (s8+), which is not the latest but is capable of running heavier apps. At least if you are gonna ""grab"" information from us, make a good game. Plus it asks you to pay to remove the ads. I mean like they are stealing information from you, putting millions of ads and they want you to pay. You could disconnect from internet and its the same as paying.",0
304,Helix Jump,"Best game I've ever played in awhile. Normally I'd be playing other games, hanging out around Roblox and stuff, but this! it's something fun, something unique, something addictive, something satisfying, and something beautiful! it is the pizza you would normally want with your soda, the french fries to your burger, the cat to your bed, the dog to play with the tennis ball. I'm glad this game is actually something fun, unlike alot of other games, other games are boring but not this one!",1
305,Helix Jump,"It is a great game to play, but I wouldn't recommend using this game while using the internet because of all the ads and how much it lags. BUT STILL THIS IS STILL AN AMAZING GAME!! Overall, this game is fun to play! Congratulations to VOODOO for creating this iconic, simple and relaxing game. Easy gameplay, and aimed for any age. Thumbs up!",1
306,Helix Crush,They copied Helix Jump(VooDoo)But As you start through about stage 1-5 they are easy and then get longer.No Ads so far like everyone else says and I like this game so if your reading this Try it out,1
307,Helix Crush,"this is the worst ripoff ever created in the history of ripoffs. Helix jump, please sue these dumb people. have never heard of a Amaton or whatever it is",0
308,Helix Crush,I really hate this game!! why? well because when ever you loose then the game starts being slow. plus all the ads appear when you are playing the game,1
309,Backgammon - Narde,"Dissatisfied with the algorithms this game has. after win of certain score dices can make you losw easily. how possibly so called randomized dices hit ""2-1"" five times in a row?!",0
310,Backgammon - Narde,This game is a scam. My opponents were getting doubles and winning all the time even when they were way behind. You will be loosing unless you spend real money to buy doubles,0
311,Backgammon - Narde,"Strange dices, no randomness. It purposefully makes you lose , in real backgammon such bizarre consequences of dices never happen",0
312,Traffic Rider,"Made it to Misson 30. The game was fun until the missions became impossible. I have the most upgraded bike and the mission requires me to overpass 30 cars in 60 seconds and it has to be a combo so if 3 seconds pass and you have not passed a car the counter resets to 30. Dont even waste your time, you'll hit a wall and not be able to advance which makes the game pointless. I want 10 hours of my life back!!!",0
313,Traffic Rider,"nice game, nice feeling of motor-drive... but if you don't want to spend a lot of money for quick progress - it becomes very boring after 1 hour - you have to drive 10+ hours on the SAME road just to achieve another road. For driving on ordinary two-way road you have to reach level 20!!! and to watch tons of adds.",0
314,Traffic Rider,"Fun game, but a major design flaw with the bikes as you progress. They need to get rid of those stupidly high windshields, they make visibility in the darker stages virtually impossible...it's bad enough that I will not give another dime to progress and will eventually uninstall it. It's a fun game, but that one design flaw is a deal breaker.",0
315,Angry Birds 2,"This game has one of the worst player support systems in place. G.. forbid when the game glitches and you don't receive the gems you've earned, as happened to me. They can care less. Also, they have very little control over hackers/cheaters in this game and the people who pay good money to play honestly, are just throwing their money away! Now, why are you showing such low quality videos with pixel problems?",0
316,Angry Birds 2,"Let me start by saying: I love this game. This game is the most fun I've had with Angry Birds, and I've had ALOT of fun with this series. Now, here's the reason for 4 stars - my experience with Daily Quests. The very first quest on the very first day of playing was 'Claim Your Gem Letter'. Every day since, it still sits there. The problem with this is that Gem Letter is a PAID feature, and I can't get a single Daily Quest completion bonus because I'm not able to afford it now. I hope Rovio sees.",1
317,Angry Birds 2,"The game is fun and all, but has some major issues, the obvious attempts to take your money being one of them, an example of this is how you can be failed on a level when things are still moving. Also the inconsistencies with the birds, the big red one that can destroy a lot of stone blocks, can be stopped by a single balloon. Speaking of balloons, a tiny one of them could hold up the world... Also controls are not always registered!",1
318,Fishdom,"This is a great game. I love the fish and their quirky remarks! However, I have a beef with the developers. There is a fishy bank and when you win a level, a diamond is deposited in it. When 50 dianonds are accumulated there is the option of buying them back. I can handle paying to buy ""the Fishy Bank"" once but repeatedly that's not on. Heck you win the flipping diamond and then you have to buy it back later! NO WAY.",1
319,Fishdom,"This used to be my favorite game because, due to its sharp graphics and distinct shapes/colors, I, as a colorblind person, was actually able to play it without getting a headache. The new update completely took that away from me. The colors are dull, the shapes all look like infant toys, this is just so sad. Latest update shows how little you listen to the players.",0
320,Fishdom,I used to love this game. It was entertaining and fun ! Now it is how we can get you to spend more money. I am tired of having hours of time That I Can not Use or give to anyone because I do not belong to face book. Technical help used to be the best now it is all computer generated and of no help. Hands being moved to make double lighting miss fire and Do not do what they are supposed to do. I have finally hit my limit. I am done Everything is made available for contests and options only .,0
321,SpeedBall,"this game is so addicting and life changing. I bring my phone everywhere so I can play it. it's a family fun game so, EVERYONE can enjoy it. none can bully you or hack your game. I play it every day after school for like ,3 HOURS STRAIGHT and on weekends or summer I play almost everyday. the ads are fine with me so, I can have a break for awhile. I love when the ball color changes into fire and goes really fast. I highly recommend it to everyone. I cant focus in school because I think about this.",1
322,SpeedBall,"THIS GAME IS SO IDICTING, so idicting in fact, I got to LEVEL 60 IN JUST 2 DAYS!!!!!. i recomend this game to anyone who randomly(or perposely)because its so fun, also i love it when the ball catches on fire. 1 more thing, can you make less ads, they pop up every 3 runs!",1
323,SpeedBall,"Speed decreases in every retry. Maybe you're doing this so that the average casual player doesn't get frustrated and leave your game, but then there's no fun. Too many ads. literally on every retry. greedy much? and after the ad closes, the game isn't paused. so i end up losing the next chance because I hit the wall. also closes randomly on Poco F1",0
324,Hole.io,"This game is a ton of fun. I love it and it entertains my kids as well! it can take a few moments to load but I love this very quiet, fun strategy game. There are only 4 starts because of the sheer amount of ads. After every single round you get a 20+ second video, usually with very loud sound. A few less ads and this would easily be a five star game",1
325,Hole.io,"I only give 4 stars on this review because I do feel like there should be more modes available. Don't get me wrong though... the 3 that are there are good. I think that given the developers history and the other apps that they have on the market I think they can really spruce this fun game up... Maybe with a ""how fast can you finish"" mode or something like that. My only other issue is there is NO sound. Other than that this game is awesome",1
326,Hole.io,"This game is very fun and I rated it five stars when it was first released. Had to reduce the rating after several updates that altered the gameplay. When first released it was possible to consume the entire modern city map. After the most recent update the hole speed has been slowed down and the map components drop slower into the hole causing a slight increase in lag. The Future City Map is very cool, however, you have no chance of 100% consumption. Still a very addictive and fun game.",1
327,Bubble Breaker,Great app apart from the screen constantly goes blank and I cannot access the game. I have to uninstall to get the image back very annoying. I would have given a higher rating if I did not have this continuing issue.,1
328,Bubble Breaker,It's a great game. Not the most addictive (thankfully)but great for a break. Thanks for making a great game that doesn't take over my life and keep reminding to play every 5 minutes.,1
329,Bubble Breaker,"This app has ads, a lot of them. HOWEVER, they run on the bottom of the screen & are not intrusive. This is a simple, straightforward game that I've found relaxing to play. Well done.",1
330,Mahjong,Best Mahjong game ive ever got my hands on! if you play fast then this is it because theres barely any ads and no fighting for more boards to play! You can even customise the pieces and backgrounds!!,1
331,Mahjong,tried new version. not only better than old but quite beautiful too. i am looking forward to many hours of enjoyment.,0
332,Mahjong,"So fun, having a daily game! The only draw back, would be that you are given SO MANY boards, that I doubt anyone can do them all! I'm still going to try! I do have one big complaint, this is NOT Mahjong, it is actually Taipei! I play Mahjong online as well as a ""board"" game and there's a HUGE difference. I would like to see it named properly, but that's not going to stop me from playing THIS version, called Mahjong Titan, it's the best Taipei game I have found! Love it!",1
333,Fire Balls 3D,An addictive game with great visuals. Firing games like this gives me relief after a very long days work. More games like this please! I haven't been playing the game for a long time yet and i still have to see what's to come so 3 stars for now. EDIT: It's becoming even more ADDICTIVE! I recommend it for those who just want to kill time while in a long line in the bank or just waiting for departure time in terminals. GREAT GAME!,1
334,Fire Balls 3D,The one star isnt for the quality of the game. The game is simple but cool as hell. The one star is for the ads. You have an advertisement after every single death and every single level. For that reason alone I am not buying the game and I'm uninstalling. I wont recommend this game to anybody else. In fact I'm going to tell people that your company sucks and this game sucks. Im going to spread so many rumors about you. Im going to one star all your games... Even if I haven't played then yet.,0
335,Fire Balls 3D,This game is really fun! But I have a hard time trying to beat the levels! U guys make it really hard! But the game is still SUPER FUN! So I don't mind the problem with that really that much.,1
336,Score! Hero,"I have mixed feelings abiut this game. At its core it is a puzzle/strategy game. the AI is dynamic, and slight changes in your passing can cause the field to be notably different. It makes for a fun ""I wonder what would happen if I..."" replayability. However, the AI can be truly infuriating. There is no way to check the level's goals before or during the level. You have to win the level once to see the goals. There's a VERY good chance that you will have to do it again for 3 stars. Costs energy.",1
337,Score! Hero,"Everything in this game deserves high praise! The graphics, gameplay, presentation, controls, camera system, broadcast, play-by-play commentary, post-match highlights and many more! This is a MUST download for most users, especially for soccer (or football) fans out there; you'll get addicted to it like me! But one downside is that if you make a mistake in one level and don't rewind in time, you start all over in that level. Other than that, it's a fun game to play.",1
338,Score! Hero,This game could be very good but if only the players weren't mentally challenged. they cant get the ball with out just giving it away so easily it is the most frustrating thing in the world. The AI needs to be a little more how do I say not stupid please just make them a little smarter and not just run straight into the opponents so the game could be 5 stars and more enjoyable.,0
339,Love Balls,This was my all time favorite game next to candy crush until recently the ads went up by about 10x!!! You literally have to watch an ad every single time you want to try again! Very unfortunate!!,0
340,Love Balls,Holy cow this thing is filled with ads! I'm getting a 15 second add every 30 seconds or so. Not worth it for some mediocre puzzles.,0
341,Love Balls,This game is great! It's very fun & easy! The only part about the game is that it wants my personal information but all else is great!,1
342,Love Balls,"Interesting and challenging levels. A lot of ads. Tooooo much. After each level, after restarts, etc. Sooo much ads!",1
343,Rise Up,"I like this game. I don't review much but this is kind of a good time killer with at least some effort. Here's what I think. Runs very fluently without problems on my Samsung. Gameplay is nice, especially with the fact of using bigger objects to block away the rest. Could be more better, overall. The controls are comfortable, too. (Protector is offset with your finger's position. Pops to the dumbasses who don't know how it works.??) Overall, this game is nice, but can be improved on",1
344,Rise Up,"It is a great idea for a app, i'll give them that. But the ads are,what i read from other reviews,uncontrollable after the first day. And the ""premium"" is that you get :no ads, and skins, and it is 4 bucks a week. The developers of this app want to be like voodoo and ketchep,which is worse with the ads and microtransactions. The gameplay gets old real quick. This is the app you get on a long car ride just to occupy your time. This game is probably a ripped off of a random flash game.",0
345,Rise Up,"this game is great but it is unplayable because there are so many ads on it. Just like every other game this company makes. For the first day it will only give you ads every once in a while and then as soon as you've had it installed for over a day the ads are inbetween every two rounds you play. They are the ads that play for the whole 10 seconds before you skip them too, and after you skip they bring you to a second screen that you have to close out of. It is insane.",0
346,Spill It!,"Great game, but still greedy after paying to disable ads. VIP membership? Really? That is hilarious, but annoying to have it pop up every few levels. Now that I think about it, that's not hilarious, that's malicious. Are you just hoping people subscribe and forget about it? Probably, considering the ""free trial"" option... I would say ""sketchy,"" but this is more like ""blatantly robbing people who don't pay attention."" I hope no one is actually subscribed...",0
347,Spill It!,15 second ads every other level. Spend 90% of the time looking at them. Would be a 5 star for entertainment but the ads make it almost unplayable because all you do is get mad you're waiting around again...10 seconds after you just watched the previous ad,0
348,Spill It!,"Very addicting. If you plan on playing a game thats great for every age that comes with various levels of fun and creativity, then youve found the right game! This game caught my eye in the form of a cute game that allows you to play your way. Although ads can get annoying I still rated five stars because the ads are not a constant annoyance, and appear after about 2 levels of playing, and can give you rewards.",1
349,Color Road,"I didn't play it yet and when I saw the ad of it saying no reaching level 2 I mean it's easy probably so don't lie stupid advertisers! Besides, what if they actually think that the girl or guy can't reach level 2? They will never install it because it'll be hard. And of you can't lie. Btw if it's that I can't reach level 2 when I play it, I'm gonna do my best to try to sue voodoo. Bye ;) Edit: I easily reached level 2, you liars. One of the reasons why I hate ads like these.",0
350,Color Road,this game is really good and it calms me down I think they should bring more games out like this because it will learn people there colours and it is calm and relaxing and I play on it all the time . so can you bring other games out like this .and it's easy for me because I know my colours and it is good to get you thumbs and fingers to move .,1
351,Color Road,"I love the game. The low rating is because of the in game ads. All phone apps has ads, but you alls ads cuts off and makes the entire game crash. Then you have to reopen the app and start over again. Especially if you watch a revive ad. I wouldn't mind paying the $2.50 to remove ads, but why spend money when the free version isn't working properly? Otherwise, would've been a 5 star. I just don't like crashing apps or games.",0
352,Sonic Dash,"I've been playing this game for a really long time, and I still enjoy it. The newest location, Mushroom Hill, looks lovely. However, the runway floor is exceptionally busy and difficult to look at. The cubes with the red X is almost entirely obscured by the leaf floor texture, the spike trip traps blends right in, and everything else is a guessing game won with luck. I just end up avoiding the location entirely if I can help it.",1
353,Sonic Dash,I really enjoy Sonic Dash and play it just about every day. It's come so far since its initial release with each update making it a much better experience. There are a few things I would like to see changed however. Only the new zones have their original music tracks but the rest have the same repetitive track. It's a bit jarring. e.g. Seaside Hill really should have it's music from Heroes. I also think that missions should give you a bit more than 5 xp when completed. I feel it's a bit too low.,1
354,Sonic Dash,"I am editing my original review. As you get further in the game I've noticed I have a lot of glitches. You can view ads to revive on a run. this works less and less. 2 out of 3 times I will view the ad then the game will force me to close and start the run again. I lost character data, I had 3 characters leveled fully.When contacting customer support they took 3 weeks to tell me they weren't able to fix the issue then closed my case, no coin gift or apology.",0
355,Shadow Fight 3,"what's wrong with your free card packets?! It says I spent 100 gems on your packet, which I didn't! it said it was free so I tapped on it, this happened twice and it's annoying because I was saving those gems! give them back! that's 200 gems! and I know you guys don't listen to some 4 star review so I'm gonna put it all the way down, cause I'm really pissed off now! Edit: ok, i press my free packet and I lost internet for 3 seconds, and then I don't get anything from it!",0
356,Shadow Fight 3,"The game is amazing as usual. I recommend this game to everyone. I have become quite addictive. The new update is amazing. Thanks for bringing the duel chest system back , this helps a lot , waiting to see every type of chests . The UI has got better.The marathons are also amazing. Although the events has become a lot tougher but still I am enjoying this game. THANK YOU for this awesome update.",1
357,Shadow Fight 3,"Wow! What a game! Honeslty, it has been a long time since I've played a game this good! I played Shadow Fight 2 and it was simply great although it was like to me ike an unfinished game. This game is simply brilliant! Graphics are great, new interface etc. There are still some things to work on like the performance optimization. I do play on a S5 so I does not help, but I still thing there some effort that needs to be put in there (game feels laggy, freezes, long time to wait etc). NO MORE WORDS.",1
358,Amo Rush,I love this game I play it every day.Thinking GAME to easy and Harder as a Challge to play,1
359,Amo Rush,Another good game let down by too many adverts less adverts = more rating stars,0
360,Amo Rush,"would be a great game if not for the eternal lag which forces you to crash every time you obviously get through an obstacle...bad bad very bad.ive seen a lot of crappy mobile game, and this is one of them",0
361,Real Casino 2,I am wondering cause I have a reception problem and I have a new frontier phone line but it doesn't seem to be inhasing my cellular service is that because it got to be linked to the computer from the phone box?! thanks so much ,1
362,Real Casino 2,"I connected to Facebook and I didn't receive the bonus they promised, what a ripoff! If they don't fix it, I will uninstall!worst slot game I've ever played... and that's counted 60 spins and best win was 600 on a 9k bet... looks cool",0
363,Real Casino 2,cant open the game because they want you to update the latest version. Tried to update but it fails to let me..They give you coins to play it's okay for awhile then after you start to play the second day you get your coins play a little and boom they make you lose all the coins,0
364,Cooking Fest,Game is a little slow from what I'm use to with my other cooking games. But I figure it will speed up once I'm out of the beginning stages. All in all its a fun game so far. I am updating my review. I downloaded this game again after i uninstalled it.. I really like this game. Its faster than it was. Its easier to upgrade. Its a good game. Im glad i gave it another chance.,1
365,Cooking Fest,this is the only game I have played that is not giving any diamonds. that is what I don't like about it. how will one be able to puchase anything that requires diamonds without buying them had I known that I would not have downloaded it . so I because of that I give it 2 stars. do not bother downloading it. it goes no where,0
366,Cooking Fest,Good game but you need to spend $$$ to buy pink diamonds to progress by upgrading... You do get some diamonds in play (every 10 levels you get 3-4) but no where near enough to be able to make all the upgrades that you need to as you go higher thru the levels. That said i do find the game fun to play and if you could earn more diamonds in play this game would be great and i would have rated 5 stars. .... I will def keep playing until i can no longer progress,1
367,Rider,"Hmmm its hard at starting and then it starts getting easier when you keep on playing. My high score is sixty-eight., pretty cool, huh?(not that much for me) so please download this game i know it's so hard at the beginning but just keep on playing it and one day will you master this game and also, try to beat my high score",1
368,Rider,"This game is absolutely amazing!! It's one of me and my friend's favorite game!! But there are some problems I'd like to point out. First, at times, it can get very, very laggy. Also, it can get very buggy. For example, sometimes I land on a moving platform (mostly the one that is straight and launches you in the air) and I phase straight under it! But overall, Rider is an amazing game! But can you please add an online race please?",1
369,Rider,"very good graphics and soundtrack, I really like the style of this game. however the game is extremely inconsistent to the point it causes extreme rage. Even in automatic stunts the game somehow manages to kill the player. In the end you need to have luck than skill so that the game not kill you in an unpredictable way.",1
370,Synthetic Z,"Fun and challenging, reminds me of Sudoku. Not sure if I'm supposed to be able to remember how all the hints are related?Great game. Totally addicted. Just wish the setup was a bit better for the harder levels.",1
371,Synthetic Z,when I'm on another app this app send an ad to my phone and hides it self has another app then when I go fo YouTube becuse I have ad blocking on I finally saw the name but guess what the picture was hidden as a flashlight app ,0
372,Synthetic Z,Game disappeared from apps and doesn't open anymore. Been getting background ads since install as well. Not good. Avoid this app.,0
373,Earth-808,"terrible controls, swipe left and your ships goes right a bit then goes left. why am I playing a shooter where I can't control the ship?",0
374,Earth-808,"Graphics aren't amazing, but they don't need to be. It has a nice retro feel to it. controls are simple. gameplay needs work. gets to a point very quickly that you need to upgrade your ship to progress, but you need to progress to upgrade your ship. or spend cash to get the materials you need instead.....",0
375,Magic Soul,fun and time passes fast. if you just want something to rest your mind this works well.Fun and almost hypnotizing. Relaxing too. My new fav app!,1
376,Magic Soul,Highly addictive and absorbing. Unfortunately this version does not have the variety of shapes that an earlier version had. This makes it simpler to get high scores. I only achieved 3145 over 6 months in the earlier one but have got twice that in two week,1
377,Magic Soul,Love this game! Great way to wind down.want to always beat the previous score.entertaining and family fun!,1
378,Aura Bubbles,Not connecting with facebook. Always gives error. Secondly the music turns on itself after each level,0
379,Aura Bubbles,great I'll see you at home later tonight and we will see how it goes and if so how much are you looking for and I will be there at like midnight tonight and tomorrow morning at top golf course is the best thing that's ever get the feeling that m not sure how much longer do you want me to pick you up from school and then I can go back to the original plan of care and have a great weekend too if that works better for you thank God you have to go through the same thing with m and m and m and I thank,1
380,Aura Bubbles,game is quite funny and good timepass but after level 108 it becomes quite tough to pass levels....sad uninstalled,0
381,Grow Empire: Rome,"I like the game. it's quite fun. I'm very interested in the Roman Empire. BUT!!! There are some things you might want to improve: the game sometimes lags then just freezes, you get bored of it in a few days, we have absolutely no control over heros and it's so hard to get gems! plus, sometimes things get a bit too expensive.",1
382,Hay Day,"I rlly love this game! I have been playing since 2013 6 years! I always loved the new updates especially the new one when you can find the gifts at Greg's farm. Maybe I could say some things to maybe give you some ideas for another update? If yes, Then I've been thinking.",1
383,Disney Dream Treats,its cute and u r warned about the Ads but u cannot op-out nor do u get any bonuses for at least viewing the annoy full screen ad. Uninstalling. Its cute to br able to use your photos but thats it. Not worth the annoying ads.,0
384,Drive and Park,"Great little game, and very addictive. Developers really need to cut back on the ad spam though. It makes the game much less enjoyable when you have to close ads so often, and when you keep getting offered to watch ads as an incentive to continue a run. I like the game but will probably uninstall soon. As fun as it is it's not worth buying just to clear the ads.",0
385,Drive and Park,"Great game. love it. amazing. literally so fun. im at level 100. Only problem: way too many ads. that's literally what every review has. You should still get the game, cause srsly what game DOESN'T have ads? And if they bug you that much, the next time you get an add, press the home button, don't clear the tab with the game, and just go back into the game and it'll get rid of the ad. boom.",1
386,Drive and Park,"As seen in a lot of these reviews, for a while there the game was completely impossible to beat after you got past the first few levels without watching ads. However, with the recent updates it's now much less forceful with its ads and is much more enjoyable to play. Is an extremely fun game and a great way to pass the time, strongly recommended!",1
387,Alien War,"Awesom...Just Awesome Really By the Way Why the Naxeex Corp called this game ""Alien War"" And there is no alien but still this is awesome",1
388,Alien War,"Well, as always Naxeex, great game! But why would you call the game ""Alien War"" when there's no aliens? By the way I love that you included dogs and armor for them I LOVE DOGS but could you please add aliens? I mean actual better aliens, I just see naked humans without a face slapping me every where I go.",1
389,Alien War,Sorry for the 1 star but I really didn't expected this creation from you Nexeex. Unlike any of your game this game is just too bad. Really bad interface in this one. The contros are really bad and gameplay is also not good .,0
390,Disney Emoji Blitz,"Game fun to play, but seems to have a lot of bugs. Under Disney I used to have game crashes 2 or 3 times a week. Now under Jam City, I am having crashes 4 to 8 times a day. I have learned to not try the sample game play in the ads, because that often causes a crash.",1
391,Disney Emoji Blitz,"The game forces you to do way too much. I feel like I have to play some long tutorial every time i play the game. limited time events boil down to, do you play this game all day, if you do you can get characters if not buy them.",0
392,Disney Emoji Blitz,"I really enjoy playing this game most of the time. It's addictive, but I hate how the game assigns you characters when you 'purchase' boxes. I have tried to enlarge my emoji family for continued game play & I keep getting duplicate emojis. There is no way to pick the emojis that you favor and the daily challenge games suck because I keep coming up with a 'pop 20 ballons' challenge and there are NO BALLOONS available on any level...so I have to spend my gems to substitute this ludicrous challenge.",0
393,Save Rocket,great game..i just love this game..this is very hard but very funny,1
394,Save Rocket,Fantastic game... Really awesome i like this game... Very interesting game.... Really best ever i played... this game deserve 5 stars... I love this game,1
395,Save Rocket,critical and hard but interesting game. UI very attractive.,1
396,The Walking Dead,"Very addicting.. need better chances at pulls.. if ya spend money be prepared to get jipped most the time lol. Barely play these days, scopley has gotten overly money hungry, everything costs these days. Game lost its touch. ",1
397,World Soccer League,"This game is by far the best android soccer game, why? Because it doesn't need internet connection, best graphic, simple to play and don't have to buy at all. I've downloaded countless soccer game, while other games try to extort money for some stupid creation, it promotes entertainment",1
398,Empires & Puzzles,I knew this game was pay-to-win when I downloaded it and that doesn't bother me. What does bother me is spending a large amount of money and still not getting the event summon. At some point the summon you're going for should just be guaranteed if you're willing to spend the money,0
399,Garena Free Fire,Hay its a nice game and I liked it very much. Some major things should be added like... 1) There must be an suspectate option so we can able to see matches played by our friends. 2) Some more new maps mudt be added....its good to have zombie map but still some more maps needed. 3) More pets should be there..... I think creators are trying their best as they have released a new pet,1
400,Bubble shooter 2,it's so so until level 100 then becomes annoying. others have mentioned why it's frustrating but the answer is it's designed that way. some business model. frustrate your customers on purpose. deleted,0
401,Critical Ops,Game that has potential. However too few gamemodes so gameplay is pretty stale. Matchmaking for ranked is unfair sometimes as i get paired up with 3 unranked while the other team has special ops. Overall fun game definitely recommend,1
402,MaskGun Multiplayer,Wow this is the most hacked game I have ever played. They shoot through the floor at you. They shoot through buildings at you. 3 buildings is my record. Ive even been killed by someone on the otherside of the map with a knife. Would be an ok game if they dealt with this issue.,0
403,Disney Emoji Blitz,Great game at first with great controls BUT after Rank 28 the power balance shifts significantly towards paying players and the items are VERY expensive to upgrade. K/D ratio has dropped 1.09% to 1.02% and the game has become very frustrating having to sacrifice stats to earn enough for upgrades. Overall good game but can really use some balancing. Some guns are too weak and some too powerful.,0
404,Modern Strike Online,"I've spend day long searching for the best FPS in the store finally i downloaded a game that didn't disappointed me in any aspect. i had a low expectations for this game but it really turned out to be the best . cheers to the makers , take my 5stars",1
405,Guns of Boom,"Very easy once you get the hang of it. I just started so I haven't run into levels that are impossible to beat just yet. Controlling all your characters is actually fun and the missions end so quickly, sometimes, you wish it was more of a challenge like the PVP mode.",1
406,Battlelands Royale,"Thanks for the game and thanks for taking time out of your lifes to make this game better and i support this game but i hade some ideas for it 1. a weapon dropping system so if we accidently grab a gun we didnt like we could pick it back up 2. plz add legdendary skins and more items in the store 3. i have a great time playing this game and i just want you to know i will buy anything from the game if i have the money Thanks, Devloper's of battlelands Royale",1
407,Idle Miner Tycoon,"Honestly, at first this looked like a dull boring game. especially for me, a 14 year old. But well done this is a great game. the further you go into the game the better!!! one again great game and I will be looking forward to another update",1
408,Airport City,I was playing airport city a long time but uninstall it this mofning because every year it is the same problems the same time yesterday my event was finish this morning all my progres was gone and the worst of all when i change devises all my nabours was gone and my allince not any more thank you,0
409,Idle City Empire,"I'm changing the rating i originally gave this game from a 3 star to a 2 star. I took a few months off of playing this game, due to stagnant gameplay. I came back today to see if this was really an ""Idle"" game and i didnt increase my in game money at all over months of being away. Also upon coming back alot of the core gameplay mechanics seem to have been gutted out now there is even less to do in this game then there was before.",0
410,Idle Farming Empire,I have played the game for about 2 weeks. I unlocked plot seven and had no issues until today. I watched an ad for double the profits and then I noticed on plot seven it said -1.44aa. It would not let me collect for plot seven. Is it because of double the profits and I am earning too much? I would very much like an answer to the problem. Thank you.,1
411,Idle Shopping Mall,"This is a great game and one of my favourites but once you've maxed the 3 shopping malls, its pretty much over. It would be great if it had a new set in a new city or something to carry on the game. As it is there is no point me keeping it now as all I can do is increase storage and that is pretty boring and pointless when there is nothing else to upgrade or buy",1
412,Merge Town!,"Game has too many ads. I played for a few weeks, bought upgrades, then it just stopped loading. No response from support at all, still doesn't work. The ads are annoying, but it can't be helped unless you pay to rid of the adds",0
413,Merge Gems!,this game is the best game ever you guys should download it I really love this game it's just very addictive and you will just need to play it even if you make a mistake or bad about you have to say sorry it's like the game that never ends but it's going to take a little long time for it said it's just the greatest game and if you guys played this game please give me a five-star liking I did that too and this is why I'm giving you this long paragraph of how great this game is.it amazing fantastic,1
414,Merge Battle,Boring. You need to watch many many ads just for faster advance. And you know it's a bad incremental game when you need more than 2 day of consecutive play and still hardly reach your first prestige...,0
415,Ice Cream Paradise,"Game was awesome until I realized that I was not getting 3 stars...played level 106 and got 230,000 points however game gave a 2 stars. But when I played again and got 50,000 points it still gave a 2 stars....having the issues with other levels as well...developers will not fix issue. Game is unfair fun while it lasted..uninstalling. So I decided to install again thinking the issue would be fixed by now however the game is not fair some levels the lever does not move and u r not rewarded stars",1
416,Evolution Galaxy,"I love this game even though I just downloaded this game. I have 2 other evolution games. the cow evolution, and the cat evolution. they are both extremely great games my favorite part about these games would have to be the berries. because they make the creature looks funny and it could give you more money. overall these are good games. I would rate these 5 out of 5 stars. thank you for making these games creator! I appreciate it! Update: It has been a c months and I absolutely adore this game!",1
417,Idle World Atom,"Same original awesomeness of Idle World, but reinvented concepts.Awesome game, is a must if you have Idle World. Itsbok, but I keep losing the weird atom thingy, so I can't make new materials.",1
418,Idle World,"There are numerous issues with this game, but considering that i have seen developers responses here and, afaik, are still developing, they turn into more nitpicks. the science concept is lovely, and has good infrastructure for a well developed game down the line. scientists and specific element upgrades do next to nothing, either their reward is too low or their requirements are too high. what scientists provide bonuses too is cool though.",1
419,Drilla: Mine and Crafting,"Well I mean hell. The game wouldn't even let me play. Damn thing kept saying and I quote, ""Something wrong with internet. Error-4. Try again."" If you're gonna make a game, make sure it runs smoothly for everyone. I find it hard to believe how everyone else was able to play this. If you feel like responding and telling me what's wrong, I'd be obliged, but for now, 1 star",0
420,Merge Farm!,"I really enjoy this game! It's simple and to the point; the tutorial doesn't drag on, unlike some other Gram games. The crop yeilds and prices are tad unbalanced, but nothing too frustrating.",1
421,Music Maker,"Love this app! Only suggestion would be that if you could make this compatible for transition format other than Bluetooth, like for YouTube or something of the sort, that would be amazing. Or if I was able to download it and have it be compatible with other apps, that would make it perfect. Other than that, I love this app. Great for making music, and it can only get better. Thank you! Edit: So my app keeps crashing, and I don't know what to do. Please help!",1
422,Scrap Clicker 2,I love it me and my friend play this game for 2 hours straight eyes hurt well mine do BUT ITS FREAKING FUN BRO edit: I'm still actually playing this game my friend stopped cause he not good at this game unlike me but my phones about to die ?? but ITS FUN,1
423,Idle Empires,The math is wrong at times. I've noticed that in the beginning area it takes less money for upgrades but the asking price doesn't reflect this. As in I'll have to have a certain amount to be able to press the button to upgrade something but then it subtracts a lower number from my gold. I'm cool with that minus the fact that I have to have more gold than what is actually required. After the Halloween event none of the ads work anymore.,0
424,Kitty Cat Clicker,"Great game!! Best game on my device for a while, though I found a bug, where 5he cats continue throwing the food when the leader is gone, so it goes to the chest, for a long time, until you purchase a new cat. To be honest I think the glitch was cool",1
425,Grow Survivor,"Ad-fest. Ads redirect to playstore whether you want them to or not. After viewing an ad and closing the play store, a pop up ad is your reward for doing so. I've never uninstalled an app over ads before, so congrats to the devs for showing me what my limits were. I'd comment on gameplay but I'm not sure what this game is supposed to be aside from a predatory ad revenue generator.",0
426,Game of Warriors,"I started this game at 3 stars... I have finally made it to wave 350 and im finally giving this game ?? ?? ?? ?? ??. My only problems with this game are to many ads but they are made up for with rewards but still a little bit to many. The spin wheel is not random at all and it gets to a point where the coin doesn't help as much any more, and ive only got the gems once and never landed on jackpot but I guess in time right? Overall, great game though very enjoyable experience.",1
427,Throne: Kingdom at War,"have not been able to log in game, have ut linked to fb and get kickout everytime. Ive been playing for over 2 yrs, but new studies/builds can take up to a year or more to complete this should really be adjusted to less time. I think also you should allow for order members to be able to shield another member with 8 hr shield, and even be able to send each other ports if needed. this is done on another game and it is really helpfull.",1
428,Cake Match 3 Mania,Thus is a good game for somene to understand the meaning of knowing which one needs to match with which. I would recomend this to ages 5 and up. My kids always come home from school and say mom can I play cake rush. They love this game!,1
429,Balloon Paradise,It is a very unique game with a lot of different boosters to help. So far l have enjoyed it. This does not mean that l may have a change of mind later as l have only played for a few levels at this point.,1
430,Water Balloon Splash,I can only give you 4stars because you do not explain how to eliminate squares. Instructions are non-existent ! I am still trying to deal with that and meanwhile the batteries on my android phone are being used up unnecessarily! Seems like a fun game otherwise!! Thanx for that!,1
431,Shoot Bubble - Fruit Splash,"I love this game, it's challenging and difficult at times but it makes you really think. and you're not constantly asking to sell me something which I like if you're low on fruit you watch a video get 10 more fruit to try to win. it's my favorite game. whoever developed this game did a fantastic job.",1
432,Pop Cubes ,"W-e-l-l...This game ""AD"" a lot of fun to your day!! There are ADS, ADS and more ADS, so if you don't mind the ADS then I recommend you try this game because it is a lot of fun, especially if you like Match 3 games. It is easy to advance the levels without waiting for more lives or spending money. i got this game yesterday and am already on Level 100. It took me a year to get to that Level on Candy Crush! I don't mind the ADS...I'm learning, not frustrated and saving money. A Win-Win concept",1
433,Toy Crush,Love this game! Haven't put ot down since i downloaded it. Its awesome....i love it. Very good game but sometimes I stuck but am enjoying.,1
434,Family Zoo: The Story,"the game constantly has issues that result in you losing coins or any boosts you use. if you contact the help desk you wont get any help from them. they will repeatedly ask you if the issue was resolved without doing anything or they will change the status to ""solved"" without even contacting you. and dont expect them to reimburse for anything you lost due to their glitches. dont waste your time or money on this game",0
435,Marvel Future Fight,"This game still amazes me. I love that almost all of the characters are here now, even the most obscure ones. I like the gameplay and the story itself. If this was available for consoles and the graphics were similar to Spider-Man I'm 100% in. The only drawback is that there are missions that require you to collect material to help you progress with the story and it just gets tiring easily.",1
436,Marvel Future Fight,"I really love this game it is so fun to play. Love the cast of characters but there are some missing that I hope you add into future updates including Mystique, Professor X, Ymir, Surter, Spider - Hamm, Okoye, and many more that are not on this list. Also, that free daily 1* character, can you make it to where I can get random character of up to 6*. Please that would be very helpful about half of my characters are 1* so this would help boost me up. I hope you take this review into consideration.",1
437,Marvel Future Fight,"Could be more fun, but I like it for what it is. I do wish that premium characters could be obtained without spending money though. Like give us chances to farm them up. Add them as a side quest, at least ones that our alliance has unlocked. Also please fix the updates, when they happen I cannot obtain the login rewards.",1
438,Hidden Hotel,"Aight, I love this game because it possible to win. Matching games was too hard. I like that they make it different. I don't mind waiting as long as when I play I knew I can make something new rather than just stuck at the same thing. Those fancy graphic was everything. Might be the best searching game I ever play. Y'all don't know how thankful I am knowing that it was not a matching game. ?? Overall great job developers.",1
439,Hidden Hotel,"Enjoying it so far. :) I like that it's a hidden object game mixed with hotel renovation instead of the usual match 3 with a hotel or house reno story. It's a great mix of genre. :) UPDATE: (More like a request) It would be great if there's something to notify/trigger us to open the club button when someone is asking for energy or when we've reached full energy. Other than that, the game is awesome! Still playing it regularly.",1
440,Hidden Hotel,"I like making the hotel new and picking out furniture and stuff, but I always have to wait so long to play bc all my energies are gone so fast. it takes a little longer than necessary to get stars. I think they should make it a little less annoying with how many energy things it takes to play. bc you only get 110 and it takes 15 of those to get like half a star. and you need one star to do 1 task so by the time the energies run out you only did like 5 task. then you wait one hour to play.",1
441,The Catapult 2,I cant get past day 2. every time I try the 3rd guy shoots directly at my catapult. upgrades are 2000 and i only get 17 dollars per attempt so its impossible to afford a shield to protect myself. I do not appreciate having to repeat the exact same process over 100 times to be able to afford to advance in the game.,0
442,The Catapult 2,"addictive and great time killer. just need more upgrading of weapons. such as supporting catapults and archers should be upgradable. besides, landmines are poor weapons. the shield should rotate more speedily while activated. the circle could be a little bigger. any protective shield could be brought for the building too",1
443,Jurrasic World Alive,"I've been playing this game for a while, and I've seen it grow for the better. Ludia has been doing extremely well at implementing new ideas such as alliance missions, weekly strike events, and opportunities to gather high tier DNA. Cons- How hard it can be to progress, I'm level 14 with VIP and it will probably take me about 3 weeks+ to level up. Arena exclusive dinos are a bad idea imo. Coins are very hard to save up. Some creatures just look stupid ",1
444,Jurrasic World Alive,"GREAT GAME, but wait, it's actually not that at all. The idea is a good idea, but the actual controls, the battle feature, the strike events and the weekly thing of dinos just suck. The battleing feature crashes half the time, everything is delayed, strike events are wayyyy to hard and cost way to much to redo, upgrades are too expensive. If you want to get invested into this game you will be constantly spending money too keep up with everyone else. It sucks, dont download this game.",0
445,Jurrasic World Alive,"This is good fun game, you don't have to spend any or loads of cash, no adverts. I live in country there for, as game uses Google maps you only get dinosaurs on the roads, some tracks. As it is designed as a ""walking fit game' would be good to find dinosaurs in the forests, moors, etc, especially for living in Scotland please fame makers! Other wise fun at the moment, easy to learn what to do. In SCOTLAND it is 'right to roam' could you put dinosaurs more every where. Thank you development team.",1
446,Planet Bomber,"This game is good. I watched an ad for it and was interested immediately. However Im greatly disappointed. Right when I open it I have deny data collection, and I have to confirm my denial TWICE. After that Im confronted with a 30 second ad after every level. You see, this is not how you make money on games. Give the player an incentive to watch the ads, like in Egg Inc (best movile game imo) Yet you, you scare away your players with this BS, thus earn less money on your dev hours.",1
447,Planet Bomber,games starts off really well with a lot of promise. its meant to be a progressive game with a promising upgrade skill tree system but after working through to level 40 and upgrading weapons to nearly level 60 i can't see any difference from the first level. Not a very rewarding game to play but that's not to say its a bad game. its addictive up until the lack of change becomes to apparent. another free game with ads so turn off internet to prevent the ads,0
448,Planet Bomber,"Pretty boring overall. No real engagement since the randomly spawning small missiles can do all the work after a while. The amount of ads is also really high. After every single stage there is an ad and if you actually try destroy the planet as fast as you can, you're pretty much faced with an ad every minute or two.",0
449,Pock 8,worst game i have ever seen No connecting with fb and google only play for guest.It's so bad game,0
450,Pock 8,Very good graphics and smooth gameplay.best pool game evr played also hindi pre-defined messages,1
451,Metal Soldiers 2,Metal soldiers 2 is a wonderful game its is a very hard game I can't complete the 10 level the monster in 10 level is very strong l can't defet him it is a very hard level I can't clear it I don't know how to kill the monster the controls should be upgraded the can not be easily killed and the life should be given more at the time of fighting with monster a great game invented I like this game very much so friends please install this game now the fighting is main part in this game bye,1
452,Sniper 3D - 2019,"i want to give this app less than Millions Trillions Stars. . only one option 1st open this game. than buy the Guns with Rs. 14,000. Bakwaaaaaas Treen App. Terrible! Controls are not stable. So tedious. Loading the next mission is slow. Ads in between. Graphics are basic. Uninstalled.",0
453,Fruit Smash,"before i install this game, i think this game is for my daughter. but is very difficult for my daughter. my daughter is 4 y.o. there is no fun, because when you reach higher stage is more difficult. and game stopped in stage 29. So i uninstall this game. thank you.",0
454,Fruit Slice,AmazingJust got it and I can already tell its better then fruit ninja on time trial my high score is already 271! One problem I think that we should be able 2 buy new blades with fruit. Oh and I think they should just get rid of the adverts altogether,1
455,Fruit Master,I really hate this game..BORING!!! I played this for so many times but I dont see any changes from level 1 to level 125 no fun no adventure in every level thats why its boring. And also in the claim reward portion I never win instruments since level 1 to 125 I hate this app...I wasted most of my time,0
456,Fruit Rivals - Juicy Blast,No one I know has ever completed this game. Everyone keeps getting stuck in Snow for months then giving up. Anyone else on this boat. I saw two or three other comments on this. something needs to me done. And now there are just too many ads,0
457,Fruits Break,When you try to get all of the items it doesn't always work. Need to be more tap / slide friendly.Worst game Downloaded it only for free gold as instructed by dead trigger 2.Your game when you're playing does not take the points of how many you need off it cheats,0
458,Fruit Tap Blast,I'm on level 214 and keeps crashing so you can't play the game and the developers are failing to respond. It was my favorite game until then. I don't want to uninstall to be sent back to level 1. Poor customer service period.,0
459,War Robots,"I LOVE this game! It is an action packed robots war game that will keep you standing until you win the match. There are about 20 robots to buy and choose from, and you can customize your guns too. I personally recomend this game for all ages. The greatest part about this game is that there is no swearing. Only blowing up other robots. I hope that everyone loves this game",1
460,Juicy Puzzle,"Best part is that you don't have to wait for ""lives"" to continue playing.Unlike other match the games, this one doesn't get impossibly hard. There are 2,000 levels and it should be possible to do them all.",1
461,Fruit Candy Blast,"At first the app is awesome, but then you get stuck on one level for weeks at a time. I'm on level 600, but it's almost impossible to get through it because the pattern NEVER changes. How can you expect to get through a level if the moves never change? Also, this app should have an option to skip a level if you get stuck on it for too long. I'm over this app. Going to delete it.",0
462,Sweet Fruit Candy,"Very cute and fun game. Functions well. There are ads, but they're easily skipped. It's worth it to get this game. It's easy to see that they aren't after money at all; they just people to have fun. This is what makes it so much fun to play. I love it!",1
463,Sweet Candy Story,Really cute game! Only iF it was more challenging...its still fun to play! It's good game to play when ur stressed! Ads don't usually bother me coz I'm usually watchin tv or I listen to my own music Idc for game music... the ads were only 5 sec long but they snuck in the 15 sec ones! Just use ur bk button keep on playin...not sure how long il keep but Ima play for a while longer maybe the game will get harder,1
464,Candy Legend,"I really enjoy this game. It is not so hard that you can't get past a level but is still challenging. I like that one can actually move foreward through the game and reach higher levels. It allows you to feel like you are able to keep going which encourages you to do so. Which means being hooked to stay and play longer. I have actually dumped games because it was almost impossible to move past even lower levels, like level 28 or 40. Other developers should take a lesson from this",1
465,Fruit Fancy,"Would give no stars if I could. Game became ""buggy"" at level 61: cannot connect fruits; items are not removed; bees do nothing; and the like. Was enjoying game, but do not understand the glitches. After reading some of the critical reviews, I believe I am not the only one with this problem. Just deleted game when I was close to clearing level, game crashed. Fix the bugs before asking gamers to play.",0
466,War Friends,"I like this game because you could make diffrent tactics and other stuff like buying new units, I just buyed Cobra which I tried and I won with it so the things are very powerful and thats why I rated it 5 stars. Thank You",1
467,Tomb of the Mask,"I don't know what the hell give you the idea that you can sell a game like this for $7.99 PER WEEK... I may as well just sell my switch to swipe up and down. You made it fun, don't get me wrong, and it's very fluid. But you've got real nerve. I've played better games for free that offer more content.",0
468,Stickman Hook,"The graphics are awesome, playing is very relaxing, the controls are perfect. the only problems are the ads, and the unability to replay challenges, as I've already beaten all of them. Also you shoud add leaderboards for the different types of modes. (Edit: Leaderboards added :D) Great game :D (Edit 2: Lowered a star cause I can't select any of the new characters...)",1
469,Snowball.io,"play it every day. it's a great game. i know that like everybody is bots and stuff, but if it bugs you THAT much, then either remove ads (I don't think it exists buteh) OR JUST TURN OFF YOUR WIFI! personally, I keep them on so that the developers still get some revenue, it's fun to play and watch some of them. it doesn't get boring for me unless I play it 2 hours straight.",1
470,Popular Wars,"Addictive!!! I love this game and it is very addictive. Need to have a power up you can get to make you population move faster for a few seconds. Like a Pac Man power up pill. So you can either catch the opponent or even get away. But change the location on the board everytime. I want royalties if you put this on the game!! ?? UPDATE: New location on the map..... ""City"", I LOVE IT!!!!!! Finally new scenery! I have been needing this. This is my go to game!! THANK YOU!",1
471,Snipers vs Thieves,"The game is boring now. The old version was way better man. It had more involved before, now it's just a basic ""Run"" or ""Shoot"". The new gadgets were good ideas, I like that, but they're so boring to use now. The game is just wack. No fun anymore. Also, I'd rather the bot not send me messages. It's just patronizing cus I already know it'll be forever before any changes.",0
472,Race the Traffic,"its not like the pictures shown. you cabt uograde stuff at 500, it automatically makes you upgrade at 1k. theres no vans as shown in the picture. theres no cars at the intersections. you cant chabge the cenery.",1
473,Creative Destruction,"Its an amazing game, even better than fortnite mo ile! you can actually build easily, and has great graphics. I had a problem with the game, and the support team responded in the same hour that I emailed them. great game with a great team, no complaints",1
474,Battle Royale,"Nepal is best than the other hand and diamonds we can follow up to complete mission of eek out the way masih links for that. weirdo oo show all posts by the way, I think it's going back in hand. free to download N-Gage games in hand with a new sui dynasty the way ma. free fire, but ma. Google photo by a new version, the last time you heard it first came to download and install a few. free fire and the way home, a few months. free to complete the last time the way ma, and the other direction",1
475,Extreme Bike Race,"not so good. what a sorry piece of junk. spend money to unlock the whole game, hell no.... uninstalling due to if they are that low, will not trust them for an",0
476,Subway Rider,Very bad game.The game is always hanging.automatically advertisement page opens. no scope for starting the game atleast.,0
477,Moto Traffic Race,It is good game according to me but anyone do not like game . So i am can't be interested to other. I like this game.In one on one they cheat they make us fall when we crash. Not the other person racing with you if he crahes.,1
478,Car Racing 2018,"So far the gameplay is good and controls are good too. Add some multiplayer if possible. Funny thing is the Ford GT-like car is faster than Veneno-like car. But one issue found why all cars are same speed and AI cars are so slow once I reached top speed and outrunned so easily and they brake so many times. Also, what is the point on drifting if the tracks are oval. And picking nitro while using the nitro is not gaining",1
479,Bike Race-Extreme City Racing,It's a good game who likes to ride bike. It is really impressive....when I got stress it used to relief my mind. this game is awesome game.try this game.it garphics is very nice,1
480,Road Driver,Fake game. It doesn't open. Screen goes black.make it little more difficul and add some terrible levels. the first levels are really boaring because it is too simple. 0,0
481,NASCAR Heat Mobile,"Good game. I like the racing! It will not let me connect to Facebook though and sometimes it does not say you are drafting. It also took me a couple restarts for it to load when I first played it, so it is not without some bugs. Overall, a great race for NASCAR fans.",1
482,Race Kings,"this is the best racing and drifting game ever with breathtaking physics! just one thing. please add some other place to race on. we just have to race at the factory type place. add some place like hills! beachsides! highways etc. please read this review if these ideas will get applied, then it will be the best game on mobile",1
483,Moto Rider GO,best bike racing good graghics good controls and does not cost money thanks. it has great graphics but need more bike you know but it is a great game.I really enjoy myself playing this game many challenges and obstacles it's just like life,1
484,Top Speed,"It's a cool game. If u follow the instructions you will be successful. The cars are not real but they are awesome. The sound is good and so are the graphics. Lots of rewards that will help raise money for upgrades and car purchases. I love the game, if u haven't played it u should try it.",1
485,Racing Xtreme 2,im really enjoying this game the moment i also hope this game brings more tiers to the game so i can enjoy it for longer. good work on the game.great game to pass the time,1
486,Stock Car Racing,"I thought this game was going to be cool, but it keeps f-ing up and cheating me out of the real place I finish in. Several times now, I have won or placed in the top three, but the damn game says I finished 8th, 11th, 12th which is bs. My ratings and opinion will continue to go down until this is fixed. So far, two thumbs definitely down.",0
487,Kart Stars,"Good game, it has a lot of control options. Pick your poison and get on the track! Awesome game. Really fun with a ton of customization...carts, drivers, suits, helmets and hats and stuff.",1
488,Mopar Drag N Brag,"It is a fun and addictive game, worth the download. I love how you can pay to get rid of adds using the money you get in game, that alone is worth a star in my opinion. As much as I am enjoying this game I cannot rate it 5 stars due to the lack of customization. Please allow us to do more, change car color, decals & vinals, rims, hood scoops, blowers, spoilers and so on. Also can you add more cars and fix the sounds of the cars when they are going down the track",1
489,Top Drives,very good enjoyable game. Just a shame the single player campaign is so short. would be great if there was an update to extend it. edit I wish I could drop below 4500 trophies as its impossible for me to compete with other people in events.,1
490,Assoluto Racing,A fantastic addition to mobile racing games. Plenty of cars and tracks to choose. The real time multilayer is also amazing. The only gripe that I have is that there is no A.I. in the single player mode. Overall its a very polished game with substantial presentation (taking inspiration from Gran Turismo). Hopefully with a future update that adds A.I. this game can have Real Racing 3 a run for its money.,1
491,Hot Wheels: Race Off,"Ads are annoying and supposedly can be removed by any purchase. This did not work for a kid's restricted Android account when making the purchase from the main account. However, customer service was great and disabled the ads for us on the restricted account. Game is super fun without getting interrupted by ads every few races! Bit too challenging for a very young hot wheels fan, although it is awesome for him to be able to identify the hot wheels he has that are in the game",0
492,Drift Max,"superb game .smooth controls ,superb graphics. and everything is good.but money for one chance is some little, please increase value for per chance.because .as u decided coast for top car 20 lacks. i wanna try every car.and one more.last stage is like a critical point so i think it should be some simple to play .otherwise excellent job",1
493,Drift Max,"would be an alright game if was not a ad literlly every minute.. start game ad. mid drift ad. plause game ad. finish track another ad.. just plain anoying and makes the game frustating expecially 20 second ads every god damn minute literlly,",0
494,Batak HD - ?nternetsiz Batak,"Enjoyable but when you open another application without finishing the game, it starts from beginning... that is the only objection what I have... and I wish we can change the names as we wish...",0
495,Race Max,Good graphics but frustrating when in contact with the Ai competitors. Cobra car seem to be programed never to win a race. Too many ads Everytime when you press the pause button It appears an AD,0
496,Batak HD Pro,"everything is great but after getting experienced at the game, u notice that AI or algorithm should be improved. computer moves are fix/standard. when u figure out the routine of code, u could win the game. computer should mitigate the risk and sometimes it should pass that current move to get more score later. unfortunately it does not. but havent seen better spades game online than this one. have to live with it",1
497,101 Okey - ?nternetsiz,Its good for offline gaming. Excellent The app is aweaome but I would realy enjoy if you can add features. I love this app.. It's so awesome! See for yourself.. I'm really satisfied.,1
498,Hearts Card Classic,too many ads! every hand! and you csnt turn off thr volume. what a waste of time. game play is fine. i would probably pay the 1.99 for this game if i coukd get rid of the ads- but that isnt an option,0
499,Hearts Card Classic,"This is a good game, and enjoyable to play. Unfortunately the advertisements are particularly intrusive and anoying, I would happily pay a fee to remove the adverts if I could find an option to do so. I understand that the makers of this game need to earn from it, but I will probably end up uninstalling it because the adverts are pissing me off.",1
500,Spades Card Classic,"Nice game . I like to play this game.This game is on the top of the list, as far as game play and controls. Well put together and smooth. But there isn't a way to play partners, which is classic, and has no online community. You're really missing out on being real competition. If you had one of these, I wouldn't be uninstalling it right now",1
