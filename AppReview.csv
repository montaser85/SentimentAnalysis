Photo Editor Pro,"This is an amazing app!! I used to use Picsart, but after their latest update, I started using Photo Editer Pro. The only problem I have is the cropping. I think you should add in another option to ""cut out"" the image. By that, I mean you should be able to trace the image you want to use- cutting out the background of the whole image. Sorry if that was a little complicating, and, other than that, the app is GREAT!!",1

I like the Oldtime Christmas Postcard look they offer.",1

SoundCloud - Music & Audio,"I'm giving up on Soundcloud and moving to Mixcloud. Can't understand Soundcloud's model - to you really need to either insist that we pay or blast us with the same intrusive adverts again and again?

Gaana Music - Hindi Tamil Telugu MP3 Songs Online,It's a great app. A few glitches here an there during downloading (queuing multiple downloads causes the app to lag) and searching (A suggestion would be keeping search results intact after we visit queue otherwise searching takes up time again).

Basically trying to chat my friend by opening the chat, typing it, and sent it but it doesn't actually sent it. going back to home then tapping the chat makes it blank (theme only without name UI and previous history messages) i had to close the app and re open it and it's becoming a huge pain, i thought my line was outdated but no it isn't. pls fix thank",0
Line,have been using this app for years. I love it and still do. I have to say though this new format where the navigation bar is at the bottom is one of the worst things I have seen. It is so bad. If it isnt broke dont fix it. I have no idea who thought this was a good idea but it is NOT. If some people like it thats awesome atleast make a setting where we can choose where we want the navigation bar.,0
Line,What has happened to LINE lately? Always have problems in receiving messages and the most annoying part is I have to on and off my handphone everytime I want to open incoming messages. Extremely bad!!!!,0
Facebook,"Very convenient, streamlined, easy to use, and not too many ads. Honestly, the only reason I'm not giving it full stars is because of the ""People You May Know"" feature being so in my face and taking up almost half of my screen every time I check my notifications.

Twitter,The concept that works on is excellent (except that it's used by the corrupt police in an amoral way) but twitter is still - all these years later since its launch - so unbelievably clunky. The software that it runs on needs to be completely redesigned. Me - I feel I might just-aswell ditch twitter as I still can't get my head round how I operate it. It's so clunky! - obviously designed by an idiot.,0

Tumblr,Tumblr has literally become a wasteland for white supremists and porn bots since the nsfw ban. Tumblr used to be a great platform for self-expression with a diverse and vibrant art comunity. These days it's little more than a draconian advertising platform with a defunct and badly implemented app lacking in function with no support. Their recent award was clearly an inside job as a last ditch attempt to stem the huge user base exodus from Tumblr.,0
Tumblr,Used ti be good. Now tags don't work and the ads are ridiculous and its censoring what people post. Tumblr deserves its place on the trash-heap if only it wasn't the only social media area where weirdness is alright. At least until Pillowfort gets going properly. But yeah: Tumblr Bad but only option.,0
Tumblr,slow slow slow! Also loses connection at least once whenever you use it. All other apps on my phone are fine. Many functions that work well on desktop do not work in the app version.

I was being followed by about 3 porn bots a day. I realize the bad of adult content was supposed to end that but honestly didn't work. The adult content on here didn't bother me, and it did I could easily block it. The bad is flagging posts that are completely appropriate and the bot problem still persists.",0
Tumblr,"the best part of this app is how unbelievably terrible it is. the new update is heavy on eyestrain, which i understand is good for some, but theres no way to turn it off. theres a new group chat feature but its almost random and you cant invite people to it, you just get added by tumblr itself. over half of the users are just TERRIBLE people and the site cannot moderate itself. for the love of GOD... if you havent created an account, think twice. its only worth it sometimes.",0
Tumblr,"I really want to like the app more but there are problems that need to be fixed. Like the avatar icon doesn't change when the blog changes them, even after months have past. It does when you log out but how many times does someone log out fron their app. Then there is the dashboard, it never updates properly. A whole week past once and it just showed the same post and I know their are new post because of my computer shows them. It's been months with these problem, why hasn't it been fixed yet.",1

Tumblr,"Porn bots spamming everything by hiding under ""safe"" tags, racism and hate running rampant, no nudity allowed, no freedom of expression allowed, no freedom of speech allowed. Basically a boring wanna-be G-rated app with very poor support and staff that don't and won't do anything to help if users run into problems. Don't waste your time downloading this app. Its basically MySpace 2.0. (4/21/2019) Update: memes good though",0
Tumblr,"Despite the ban on porn and NSFW content, I still see multiple ads containing explicit pictures of women complete nude. The posts complaining about these ads with a screenshot get flagged and taken down, so why dont the ads? While I dont agree with the terms of the ban, it would have been better to satisfy something the user base asked for and that would be the removal of the hate groups, nazis, and pedophiles. Despite various reports, they still roam",0
Tumblr,"Really went down hill after they started monitoring content with an open source software. Normal selfies I posted when I was 13 were deemed explicit and it caused my blog to be banned. I had to appeal to the staff to get that ratified. I don't mind that the website is banning explicit content, but the fact that I don't post content that the algorithm would consider ""explicit"" and have these problems leads me to believe that there's major disorganization in regards to how this website's run.",0
Tumblr,"I am a fan of tumblr since 2010. And really still loyal with it compared to other social media apps up to today. I just wish that you have a free data feature where in we can still posts,like, and reblog because not everyone of us bloggers have wifi at home or data in their phone.

It's a well polished web UI and the app is fast and smooth. things can only get better",1
MeWe,mewe keeps making it necessary to uninstall and install before letting me have access to mewe. I do not like to have to do this daily. The problem has been resolved and now I am liking MeWe much better especially the option of posting to my friends or to public.,1
MeWe,It's basically Google Plus 2. Would greatly improve from some quality of life features such as changing accounts without having to sign out of one (like on Twiiter). Breaks down a lot too along with some glitches. Has lots of growing to do.,0

MeWe,Super blinding white splash screen when on dark Theme NEEDS TO GO!! Needs categories in groups. And God does it need collections and circles from G+. And many other basic needs. Mewe takes FOREVER to add any new feature. Has plenty of potential but the missing features and how long it takes to add these makes me feel it's not going to grow or get new people.,0
MeWe,"It's a great replacement for Google+. Though one feature that everyone would love to have is the ability to add multiple accounts and switch them around. Some of us use alternate accounts and would love to have that feature. logging in and out and back in again is just too tedious. Please make it happen, MeWe team!! edit: your porn bots are back in force. they're posting in groups they've never been accepted to",0
MeWe,Unfortunately it is not very user friendly... One has to go through a lot of steps to get where you want to be... If you do t know your way around MeWe its very frustrating.. Many people will give up on the app because of that Make it more user friendly and people will flock to the app.,0
MeWe,"5 star concept. MeWe doesnt make money by selling my attention, this means that i can use this app for ONLY what i want it for, and there aren't engineers trying to figure out how to get me to sleep less and use their app more. I don't mind paying for a great product, so i subscribed to premium calling and video chat ($1.99/mo). There is some room for improvement, but this app is really smooth all things considered.",0
MeWe,"I switched to this after G+ shut down. definitely taking some getting used to. I'm almost feel like it's overdone. When i get a pop-up notification on my phone and i click on it, I expect the notifications to be cleared in the app as well. small things like that need improvement. Other than that, everything works and im able to stay in contact with friends effectively.",0
MeWe,"i never rate apps but i felt like i should take the time to rate this app. As a g+ vet, I'm very impressed with this app. it's easy to use and it's very well set up. all i would suggest is 1. a clear all button for mobile notifications 2. a way to only view UNREAD notifs 3. some type of collections. right now im using albums to categorize my posts, but i don't want to always have to post a picture with my post other than those three things, the app is wonderful",1
MeWe,"does this app support on Laptop with windows 10? It was working earlier in my android(4.7) mobile but because of some other issue I had to uninstall it...And now when I tried to reinstall it, I couldn't find it on my Play store.",0
MeWe,"The concept is nice but there are minor issues to be sorted, like a simple translate feature. i have many friends who speak other languages and it is difficult to decipher what they are saying unless i copy and paste it into a seperate translation site.

MeWe,"Solve the flaws of your app, give its user interface design a profound overhaul, and add all features of Google+. If you don't do this then your social network will always stay being a little meaningless flower in the shadows.",1
MeWe,Best Google+ alternative so far. Improvements are being made to the app constantly and that is appreciated. I'm sure no one is going to be 100% happy all the time. MeWe is the place to be if you're an ex Plusser. 👍,1
MeWe,MeWe is not as interesting as G+ was. It's not so straight forward and easy as I expected it to be. if one post a picture on public or home it doesn't show on my time line. More over quite a few friends that I know cannot sign up with MeWe app. They have been trying for a long time. Thank you.,0
MeWe,"Having a problem with your GIF option in private messaging. I can search and send the GIFs, but it does not show up in my message content, even though it says ""you sent a gif"". If there's an issue with this, would love for it to be fixed.... otherwise fabulous app, I love everything about it!",1
MeWe,"i see nothing but my followers posts. your nothing like google+ and will never be. if i were you, add public real fast. cause as much as i like to see old faces, i love to see new ones.",0
MeWe,"Brilliant Facebook and Google replacement, just wish there was a combined news feed that shows posts from all groups I'm followin in one feed so i can just scroll through... Maybe thats not the intention but I'd use it. Still 5 stars for an exceptional app!!!",0
MeWe,My gmail account has had a significant increase in spam and there's a few more scammers but I enjoy the freedom from being censored by people in charge of Facebook who's morals are much worse than anything that's posted.,0
MeWe,"I think am going to delete the app, waisted time and data downloading it but i can't sign in , I've been trying to sign since 2days and its telling me, my phone number have being used to log in, its crappy.",0
MeWe,"Great App, took a little getting used to but allows for chatting and media. The Gif link in Chat stopped working about a week ago but nothing has been updated and I don't even see an acknowledgement of a fix or working on it. Other than that, it's been great",1
MeWe,"Edited to add: I can now post a pic to my profile and i can make a photo album for the pic. HOWEVER, once that is done, my albums are not showing on my profile page for me or anybody else to find or see. its very good except you cant make photo albums for your profile while using your phone. Also the pages (not personal profile) cant be deleted or edited properly. i like the voice clips feature and all the emojis. Overall its a good alternative to the controlling, fascist facebook.",0
MeWe,It's great as an alternative to fb. But it needs improving... It's abit rough around the edges but it's new so I'm sticking whilst fb adds more and more ads and rules. This could overtake fb. I just hope they are quick on updates and listen to what people want...,0
MeWe,"NOT FACEBOOK! That's why I love it! I'm so sick of the way FB takes all your info and mishandled it. Sells it, or simply loses it to hackers. This app is everything I loved about FB 10 years ago. Without all the FB jails... and other stuff.",1
KiK,"Very great app. Been using it for a long time now and I love it, especially with the new features. I just wish you could reply within the notification. That way you could answer faster and wouldn't have to open the app every single time you get a new chat. Otherwise it's a great app and hope to see new features.",1
KiK,"Really getting tired of the constant crashes. Ever so often I try to open the app to check/respond to messages and it won't allow me to anything. I tap the icon to open the app, then a message appears that says ""Unable to open"" or Kik stopped working, try again"" It's really getting annoying, thinking about switching all my contacts over to MeWe",0
KiK,"Worst response! My messages were not going out, not even getting into sent status. I uninstalled an reinstalled the app. Now I am not able to log in at all. I send an email to their support center and receive an automated response saying ""we aren't able to respond to general inquiries at this time. Check out our Help Center to find more information about your question or concern"" and their help center link is not working either! Worst attitude, don't give a damn about the users!!",0
KiK,"some real perverts on this app. I know it's not the developers fault but yeah. be careful. I always ended up replying late because I would never notice the notify because it didn't stick out. it never qpepared in front of your face, just in the top left corner. it's a bit annoying. the calls always ...",0
KiK,"It's a good chatting app with some issues. It's doesn't work with slow internet. If I try to send message when no internet connection and close the app, it's won't send the message until and unless I open the app again even if internet has started working already. Also, I can't send external gif, only in app can be sent.",0
KiK,i very much dislike the new update with the pop up at the bottom for finding other people on kik. the reason i dislike that feature is because i cant hide it and i keep accidentally clicking it when scrolling through my chats with my real life friends and family. i got kik so i could connect with them NOT strangers. so if you could please fix this and at least make it possible to hide this feature and make it part of the public chat option it would be much appriciated. thank you.,0
KiK,"ive been using the app for a couple years now but recently, its started acting up with not sending messages. not being able to receive any messages. and it does this randomly for a few days, it makes me mad because i use this app to talk with alot of my friends and some family. i hope this issue gets fixed.",0
KiK,good app but i have two suggestions 1: saved as draft: I happen to write and then accidentally move away to answer a shorter reply and then what I wrote isn't saved. if I write hello without sending and tap on the pile to go to my message history then it won't be saved. I want that future to be added so that I can save. a pin function. I want to be able to pin important conversations above other ones. please enable these.,1
KiK,"I have been using this app for years and it seems to have slowly been declining in quality, half the time my messages do not reach my friend. We have done multiple tests to check what was wrong but it is sporadic and unreliable. We want to continue using kik but it seems to have lowered in usability.",0
KiK,"Hackers are over running kik, this is getting out of hand! They are getting ppls numbers and information irl, this app aint safe anymore! Get it handled now kik its sad we aint safe anymore cuz tou guys dont keep these hackers at bay",1
KiK,"I really need to speak to a human but Kik doesn't have human developers it seems... Guess Kik made itself then... My account is suspended for no fault of my own. i really would like to speak to someone, please... i try to send emails but all i get back is am automated blah blah ""We will not be reins...Full Review",0
KiK,A year ago I would have given the app 5 stars. Ever since Kin was introduced the app has been unstable and frustrating. I wish your engineers would concentrate on developing some useful features and abandon kin. Kin is a worthless feature that almost nobody finds value in. I'd rather have a stable a...,0
KiK,"I've been on kik over 1930 days. Quizzes to earn kin haven't been available in months ?? Uninstalled/ reinstalled.. still no marketplace??

KiK,"messages say they send but dont actually send, the messages i get are delayed by an hour which is annoying when kik is the only way i chat with a couple of my friends. maybe instead of screwing around with extra stuff you guys could.... oh idk MAKE THE CHAT FUNCTION WORK!! for a chat app, of late yo...",0
KiK,"This is a great app and all.

KiK,"Unable to access my account.. Unable to log in or message anyone... Facing this problem from past 3days..uninstalled several times and re-installed stil unable to log in.. It says ""taking longer time than expected to log in please try again after sometime"".. Please look into the issue",0
KiK,"I love this app, for whatever reason the kin market place is not working. Everytime I try to earn kin to get new backgrounds it says ""come back tomorrow for more great oppertunities. I fail to see how the new update has made the kin market place a better expierence. I washavong issues with it before updating. After updating, still having the same issue! Please fix!",0
KiK,3 stars cos right after this last update.. i couldn't use it on my mobile data.. it only works on wifi.. i did everything possible but same.. it stuck there on mobile data like no data activated.. but other application works fine.. please resolve this as soon as possible.. i love this app..,0
KiK,I recently deleted my app. and now that I have redownloaded the app my messages are only saying they have sent and not delivered. I know connection is good on my side and have tried many things but still hasn't worked. I tried to look on the help page and nothing they suggest is helping. please fix.,0
KiK,"Great app. Just one bad thing..that is, the verification. it sucks...i can't figure out 20 times at once! it can be wrong once! and thus i can't 't open the app. can u please fix this somehow ?",1
KiK,"I used to love this app a lot. But from few days, I am not able to login or signup to a new account which is very frustrating. I tried uninstalling and install again and also switched networks but of no use. Please fix these bugs or else you might be losing many users like me.",0
KiK,"Why can't I log in to my kik account anymore?? This problem started not long ago after the app became unresponsive out of nowhere while I was using it. I logged out and relaunched kik but since then I haven't been able to log in even after filling my account details. It keeps saying 'log in failed, this is taking longer than usual' after I press the login button. Kik used to be a great app before this happened. How to fix this?Please help! Thanks.",0
MeetUp,"I love Meetup! It's a great way to make friends if you're new in your community. A great way to connect with friends for a local So-Cal like myself. This is not limited to the U.S. It's worldwide. It's for all ages and great if your single and looking for something new to do, like myself. If you're married this app's for you, too. Try something new...go out & enjoy yourself! If you can't find something you'd like to do, it's very easy to start your own meetup group.",1
MeetUp,"I have been lonely for a while since I moved out from my family. I tried a few apps it didn't work since they focus on relationships. All I need is friend I can talk to, so meetup help me right away. It fits to my purpose. I can join any activities that are available. It's a new way to find group of people to socialize with.",1
MeetUp,"Extremely buggy and lacking most of the useful features from the website. It sounds like this is an Android issue, but I really don't understand how an app that updates so frequently can be so bad. I use the web version more often because it actually works.",0
MeetUp,it would be nice if geolocation was used to inform the Meetup host how many guests are about to arrive at the Meetup location and automatically remove those who appear to not be coming based on their location and vector. would also be nice if uploading photos actually worked I would be really great if the dev would respond to this review,1
MeetUp,I love it. easy place to find all the clubs in my region. I have joined several social groups including fitness and sport and fun ones too. I also found a club for just about everyone in my family.,1
MeetUp,Finally someone think my idea. If you haven't done this program I would do it. But I looked your program and your program has a bug. I couldn't upload any photo. It doesn't upload. It made me mad.,0
MeetUp,The whole meetup experience has been great for me. This app makes it so easy to communicate with other members and to get relevant information on upcoming events. Great features like uploading pictures and both public and private chats make this app a vital part of meetup.,1
MeetUp,"something wrong last update it log me out and I can't log in again, before never log me out. Say this account is not verified log in on web but when I go on website say your acc has been disabled for spam you guys need to fix it....",0
MeetUp,"It has been good and it's been moving forward. One thing I don't like is the discussion part you can only write a small amount to start with and is the same for the reply so it can make interactions a little harder, but other than that it's pretty good. Also read the sites instructions first so you know what you are purchasing referrencing theor standards for posting",1
MeetUp,"Great place to find other people who like the same things you do or even new things and if you kind of like nerdy things that too . The app.helps connect you with them.It is all up too you to join in or not. App has boardgames ,the greatoutdoors ,mommy met ups,healthy groups, spiritual groups , even a witches group list goes on .If you don't find something you can create group. of your own .It's what ever your preferences are to try, Get out of your comfort zone and try a group or 2. I did",1
MeetUp,"i like this service, but the app has some issues especially in account setting and messaging function. no matter how i tried to modify my settng, it is reset all the time. and sometimes i couldn't send msg to the ppl who should be able to receive my message. please address these issues. thank you",0
MeetUp,when I tried to see what my old account was it just made a new one instead. my new one is in the wrong address and doesn't have the history from last time I lived here. it also won't let me change my location or light into another account.,0
MeetUp,"The app does not allow me to change my home location. I moved from Seattle a year ago and it says I am still there. There is an edit field for location, but I cannot select it.",0
MeetUp,Too expensive for organizers in poor countries. One of the events I was attending was removed from meetup because the organizer could not afford it. I would rather prefer ads than the current system.,0
MeetUp,Potential to be a very useful app but major bugs in software. Message function plays up all the time saying messages aren't sending then sending them multiple times making you look like a right fruit loop! Sort it out!!,0
MeetUp,"I've subsribed for meetup App around two years ago. 6 months after taking subscription, i've unsubscribed the same as it was not upto the value of subscription. At every 6 months, they automatically debit money from my account, same happened today also. I don't know what should i do, i mailed them but the error coming there. Can someone help me out, what should i do?",0
MeetUp,"often when I join on an event and click on attendees I get message ""sorry, something went wrong. please try again."" How do I fix this? I've tried re-logging in, reinstalling app nothing works. It's been doing this for months.",0
MeetUp,"It's getting better with each update - messages are easier to send and receive, and events are clear. Nobody seems to notice the discussions section though. Is it not obvious enough?",1
MeetUp,3 attempts to sign up after spending forever picking groups wouldn't take my picture multiple tried and then eventually it did and then just kept timing out when 'creating my account'. this backwards setup process is super frustrating. never did get in.,0
MeetUp,"Good app. But a little hard to find good events. Please add options to sort the meetups based on number of people interested, going, etc.",1
MeetUp,"Opens quick so i dont have to login everytime. A few glitches where it shuts down randomly but after it closes and opens back up again, its fine.",0
MeetUp,Very useful app. I have discovered nice things through it. It lacks some features that would make it so much better. - Being able to subscribe to an event without confirming presence. - Using attendees' reported past attendance to predict how many seats will probably be filled at an event.,1
MeetUp,"It is really handy to find and meet like minded people. Good for networking be it for job or otherwise. Also, helpful to settle down in a new place.",1
MeetUp,"So easy to find like-minded people and meet up with them, keep track on future dates, pictures of other members make it easy to recognise the right crowd",1
AnyGram,"this app is so lame! it broke my heart. 12 or more than that hours had passed and it was going alright but then out of nowhere, it suspended me from chatting till 5 may saying that i haven't been following the policy... like what the Heck! i talked to a few (2) people and we were already great friends and then it suspended me without any appropriate reason and the next thing i know is that it deleted my account... my whole hardwork in collectimng points and this & that gone to waste... i hate it!",0
AnyGram,This is the app I have been looking for. Able to make great friends around the world and fake accounts can be verified easily. Keep up the good work. Though some minor changes are required. I am hoping to hear from the developers soon.,1
AnyGram,"Joined up, finished profile, made a correction to someone's grammar (people post in a section for native speakers to do this), 1 request to be a friend and then instantly suspended for too many reports and low reviews. Tons of perverts and fake accounts, a nonexistent customer service, and just plain bad management of information. Worst app I've ever downloaded and I don't review any apps...",0
AnyGram,"the app sometimes takes a while to load and it's kinda old fashioned. Other then that, it's perfect for making new friends and learning about other countries. You can report people if they've done/said something bad and you can rate people too.",0
AnyGram,it crashes sometimes ...please add a method to know if the other person who i am chatting with is writing now ....but thank you for the almost free app not like the other apps this is uniqe thank you.,1
AnyGram,it was quiet good experience and people are also nice over there. but i had some issue using it that without any notification or something i got suspended. and i couldn't reply to anyone now. either let me know where i was wrong or remove that suspension and the tag. please help me out with that.,0
AnyGram,"It's nice but the text format is outdated, and there should be explanations of how to use it when you first download it, earning points is also very difficult in the beginning - you should be able to start with 100 so that you can actually learn how to use it",0
AnyGram,"App is not bad at all, but need aome improvements in chat section and overall fluidity. Adding features like message seen and chatting person is online or not would be better. The main issue is females dun chat that much!!!",0
AnyGram,It's always running on the background and you have to force it to stop from settings. it's really annoying and drains way too much battery. please fix it,0
AnyGram,"was working fine last year. now whenever i try to open a chat, the app crashes Edit: update came pretty quick! sadly it didnt fix it for me. do you guys need a bug report? or can you see what went wrong for me? it said that it couldn't create a chatroom. if you need the report let me know and good luck!",0
AnyGram,"I really love this app, it helps me make new friends and meet new people!! Why did the chat option stop working?",0
AnyGram,"actually its a good app but i can't log in sometimes, although i have internet connection. now i cant log in again and its really annoying.",0
AnyGram,"when No one has their time for chatting then why are u people wasting your precious time for developing this type of chatting app, I don't know what are you have in making this app !! well no one has time for talking or chatting, so developers please stop developing this app And remove it from the store!! And something NEW on your creative mind !!",0
AnyGram,Anygram is a really Extraordinary app i love using anygram Because it helped me communicate with new new friends from around the world. And that's what I'm enjoying very well,1
AnyGram,"attn : this apps are critical for power resource,to developer i'm running this app via android 8+ and keep get reminded of power draining even after logged out unless a mandatory force close manually.",0
AnyGram,The app should let you talk with more than 5 people for free. And also it should be aware of some users bad intentions shown by their posts,1
AnyGram,The setup and lay out sucks. Also the policies require you to expose your face. profile pictures cant be anything but a face pics. Disrespectful of privacy.,0
AnyGram,In general this app is good for learning the language and for getting friends. There is one problem: slow performance,1
AnyGram,so.. basically this app is good but it keeps crashing a lot :(.. it doesnt allow to open my account.. please fix the issues.. else this app is good,1
AnyGram,Nice app to meet international friend. People are here amazing. They can help to know about language. Tourist attractions. And friendship with any ages.,1
AnyGram,why not Anygram give a option of Video calling Facility! As its not a any doubt of lot fake profile in the Anygram ! so video call option will be make something nice clear and judge the fake profile !,0
AnyGram,"Anygram Is AN Awesome APP IN Many Ways rather than Instagram, Facebook, snapchat and so on. I know they are popular but it doesn't matter. I'd say give it a try then u will feel good experienci🤗🤗best of luck my friends. Merci beaucoup 😍😍horway Aryans from India ",1
AnyGram,Amazing app. You can meet people around the world and learn different languages!!,0
AnyGram,"it is an easy app to use, it allows people of almost all ages to sign in and you can talk to people in many different countries.",0

Twinme,"I really like the concept but there are some minor issues: - The app doesn't support Vietnamese *displaying* so I get error characters (sorry, not *typing* like I wrote) - Lack of emoji & sticker samples and self-destruct timer. - I can't find where to adjust notification sound and text size. - The external speaker volume is too low, almost the same while turning off.",0
Twinme,"I rarely leave a review, but I appreciate this app and its developer(s). They clearly care about their users - they comment on nearly every review and they quickly reply to any feedback. The app itself is great and I love it. The only features I would like to be added soon is saving received media and rotating video to landscape mode when viewed in the app. For the media I've already sent feedback and I was told it's being added soon. Looking forward to it! Very nice app. Thank you.",1

Twinme,"doesnt work at all (Germany) and my friend in Turkey said the same. edit: it came back to work again thanks!!! even if I want to send you feedback from the app itself, couldnt coz the whole screen stopped as if you opened a picture and you can't press any button.",0
Twinme,messages have been coming thru in the wrong order and calls can be sketchy but besides that it's an awesome app,1
Twinme,"Excellent tool for private wifi-based communications. Easy to use and understand. However, there's no way to save an image someone sends you.",1

Plus the app is free. I would definitely recommend this app to any one that wants to contact their friends by text ,call or video call for free. overall this app deserves a 5!",1
JusTalk,Calls and messages are not receiving even it is online. Need try many times to connect. both of them can't recieve the messages or calls even if we are in online. Sometimes it will work (after trying around 10-20 times). my location is in India.,0

JusTalk,"Like... app works fine...misunderstood what your trying to say about recording a video , under the impression you could record a video then send it to anyone, not while your on V-chat, but beforehand like in Skype .Can't find a video record button , only when I'm already in video chat , I see record voice button at the bottom of the send message with Emojis pictures Etc .If we could record a video message then send it to someone like on skype that would be cool .thanks :)",0
JusTalk,I love being to video call my husband when he's away on a case. Because he likes his iPhone and i love Android so we cant Duo or FaceTime each other with our app on our phone. so thank you for making something so people can stay connected and not feel so far away because they only hear a voice.,1
JusTalk,Good app..we can easily connect with our friends and family.A very good platform to chat and video call. I can promote your application on my like account it's similar like tik tok. I am having more than thousand of fans. so if you give me a chance so I can promote just talk app,0
JusTalk,"Love it! Great way to communicate with my children when they aren't home. My daughter has all her friends connected as well. A group video option would be icing on the cake however, it is still deserving of five starts without it.",1
JusTalk,"This app operates in fixed focus mode, it will not automatically or manually focus on images very close to the lens. I am very disappointed. Please fix this.",0

JusTalk,The best among equals! The only problem is that the other party doesn't hear you immediately you speak while on voice calls. It takes about 2 to 3 seconds after you must have spoken for the other party to hear what you have said and vice-versa. Please look into this issue.,0
JusTalk,"Im gone away from my wife and really like this app for the video chat. The video call, messaging all work great. Will continue to use, you guys did a great job with this app.",1
JusTalk,I love this app. even when my phone is only running on WiFi it works and I use it a lot. every other video chat app ive tried didn't work and sucked but this one works great in the woods or anywhere. hope this helps,1
JusTalk,it is a great app for parents to get in contact with their kids in an emergency or just to say hi .This app is a money saver it defeats the purpose of a phone.The only thing in the way of being five stars is the need for internet. If you didn't need wifi for this app it would have five stars for me,1
JusTalk,"This app is fine. I would recommend it because you don't have to struggle with codes, and waiting. But the quality of the calls is not the best. Video quality is not amazing and sound is constantly glitching up. my IPhone is currently in rice, and I needed an alternative of facetime for the time being. this works fine.",0
JusTalk,"I never thought i could phone my friends as i am not aloud alot of other things but now i can ,i can alsow chalange them at games and other things.You can pay on apps whilst phoning it is amazing being able to talk to there faces when im not in school.Somtimes it is a bit fuzzy when you phone them but seconds later you can here them clearly",0
JusTalk,I could talk to my friends and when I need something I can get off the app when I'm talking to them so I think this is a 5 star you ever says this is rong then you might be rong,1
JusTalk,i installed the app to all my friend's phones and we discovered it was a fast and interesting way of communicating with each other but what we injoyed most is video calls on group chats # keep it up # guys download and share this app its really awesome,1
JusTalk,it always turns on speaker and starts glitching when i get off the app and switch to another one . also when u try to screen record it goes in slow motion and i think it should go at the regular speed. other than that its an awsome app,0
JusTalk,"awesome app it's just echoing alot but, me and my bff live 800 miles away sooo.. I dont really know but if we were closer it would be great!!!",0

Tubi,I LOVE Tubi! It gives me the ability to watch movies and shows with my granddaughter that we both like without having to pay the ever increasing costs of cable and Netflix. I will HAPPILY watch a few commercials to be able to watch great videos for free. I was even able to get my grumpy son-in-law to install it on his phone because he liked all the stuff too. I recommend EVERYONE installing Tubi on all their devices!,1
Tubi,"Nice selection. A few commercials, but probably fewer than on a network. Nice to be able to pause and resume whenever you want.",0
Tubi,"i have never had anytype of problems out of this app. every movie ran smooth. so many choices in movies and different selections that you will be satisfied in any class of movie you choose. never stops or slows down and always starts up quickly. this is the best movie app out there by far , free movies up to date any many new releases. select, save, and pick up where u left off. very fine app. tubi is the best !!!!",1
Tubi,"Love it so far. Watched one movie with no problems or issues. Only had 2 short commercials, about 10 seconds each. By far the best app I've used yet and I've used many.",1
Tubi,Love it love it love it. Forget NetFlix and Amazon Prime they offer a free trial and its awesome but then they want $$$. Tubi never asks for $$$ and you get GREAT movies. No buffering no waiting for your movie to load nothing slow about it. Yea you get 2-3 15-30 second commericals ever so often but TV programming is a lot worse. So all in all I'd give them 10 stars but it wasn't an option!,1
Tubi,it needs more movies like mean girls or little the one that came out on april 12 did you see it it do not have the speashel thing that be on neflix or hulu or Plex. oh and it is not good to have scary movies on tubu- free movies ,0
Tubi,"I love this app great movies and so many selection of movies to choose to watch.action,drama,comedy,and horror but my favorite one of all is marital art movies I'm a big fan when it comes to marital movie old or new good graphics and most of all it's free thank you.",1
Tubi,Selections are good. Enjoying the horror movies an old TV shows. Have yet to have any problems and would definitely recommend this app to my friends.,0
Tubi,"I love B movies and this has them!! If your a movie buff, this is the one for you. Been tired of the new Hollywood scene, they suck with rehashed cinema classics.",1
Viber,"Don't get tricked. This app might seem good, but inside there are barely any movies. No avengers movies, no star wars movies, nothing.",0
Viber,great app has alot of great movies and tv shows all for free. There's a few ads here and there but hey its free people. Works great on my rokus and my android phone. Keep up the great work Tubi.,1
Tubi,Tubi has some really good programs and movies the commercials are short and don't happen frequently. It was recommended and I have not been disappointed.,1
Tubi,you all have two different faith-based movie lines that is very important for me. Y'all also have a good mix of other types of movies that I also en,1
Tubi,"Don't bother with this one, the developers are dishonest. It's ad supported because it's free, so when it cut to one a few minutes into the film, it was jarring, but expected. I hit the ""back"" button and a message said the movie would return after two ads. I endured both, but a third started. I hit ""back"" to try and escape the extra ad, and a fourth started, and a message then said the film would continue after three ads. The app can't even keep it's scams straight. Don't waste your time.",0
Tubi,"Great movie and tv show selections. And damn it, its free. Not too many ads and when there are, they are very short. In my opinion this is the best free movie app out there right now. Never had any problems loading up. Huge selection of stuff for free. A lot of older stuff on here. Try finding the Weird Science tv show from the 90s for free anywhere else. Lots of those classic shows from the 70s and 80s like 6 Million Dollar Man, Bionic Woman, The Hulk. Love it.",1
Tubi,".a generous four stars for content, but a much lower rating, if I could, on overall functionality of the app. I've had it, then deleted it, all because the app is so lacking as far as keeping a connection and moving on to the next episode in a series... I'd love to see some improvements. I feel confident that it has nothing to do with my equipment here as I do not have these issues any other time I am streaming. Again, great selection of content considering there is no charge...",0
Tubi,"Very neat, far better than what I expected. The movie's and shows aren't the most RECENT blockbusters but they WERE a year or so ago & are still great movies & shows. If you're looking for something to watch that's not on TV or Netflix & it's FREE this is a pretty awesome little app, give it a try. I've had no problems & it's user friendly. Using this has made being a terminal insomniac more bearable & the late night hours don't seem as long. I recommend it",1
Tubi,It was bad. I loved it in the beginning but its suddenly stopping every 10 seconds. I have deleted cache and data. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it. My system is up to date. I turned my android off and back on. It still wont play movies. I thought this was best of all but Not anymore. Dont know what else to do. Getting ready to remove it and look for another. Can you fix this??????,0
Tubi,"Tubi is quite simply too good to be true. The movies are free The selection is brilliant, especially the documentaries and the cult stuff. Someone has incredible taste! There's only a few commercials, like maybe two per movie, and one of the local ads was actually helpful! Maybe there will be.charge someday, or maybe you wont like what I like, but its worth a look, especially if you think the movies at Krackle are meh. I paid for Netflix, but Ive barely touched it since I found Tubi!",1
Tubi,"i watch Tubi more than Netflix account. This is such a cool network. i only have 2 proplems with it. 1) sometimes the commercials are so loud they're almost deafening, especially if i'm watching on my cell phone and using earphones. 2) WhenI try to watch a movie, sometimes it will buffer every 10 or 15 seconds. When I stop the app and restart it, it doesn't fix the issue. Why is this happening? it doesn't do it with TV shows.",0

"Photo Editor Pro: Photo Collage, Picture Editor",very good to edit and it also has a secret valt code number 4 numbers. For private things good for a lot more than you would think. you should realy this app. It's good for privacy and security for your private pictures you edit. And you can re arrange the way the way your pictures ar put too. If yplou wonder how good it is well it's great. you should realy get this it will briden any thing you think and make it a lot better than before.

"Photo Editor Pro: Photo Collage, Picture Editor","I'd been long looking for an app that can provide me with the feature of free style collage -exactly the one you have-among all the collage maker apps for a professional piece of work, until I finally got to find this app . the features that u can improve are the background themes ( like inserting a pic, texture, etc.) and make the free style feature even more natural and beautiful by letting the free parts of the images fall out of the background edge. thanks 😊",1
"Photo Editor Pro: Photo Collage, Picture Editor","If you are concerned about your security, dont install this app. It pops up add anytime even when I am not using the app or at the home screen. This is really annoying.Thus, I checked my settings to uncheck the ""display over other apps"". To my surprise, it was already unchecked. The app changes some system settings without your authorization and hides it. And when you try to determine where these ads are coming from, they disappear on its own.",0
Photo Editor Pro,"Very nice, in fact its amazing, it allows you to really get the detail into something you want to edit. Although the could have an enhancer to reduce blur when you crop an image, but its great! Very nice work to the developers, ads aren't very populated and its easy to work with.",1
Photo Editor Pro,there are much better truly free (ad sponsored) apps. you are forced to buy different effects and this will make the app very expensive.,0
Photo Editor Pro,"I am enjoying using Photo Editor Pro, 4 *s from me. It's a great app and I want to give 5 *s. But It's only the style of fonts and lack of choice of fonts, that I found frustrating, but otherwise I love it.",1
Photo Editor Pro,"this is app which is in playstore... many of the people wants to edit their photos... but most of them doesnt have more money to spend on these kinds of apps.. and int the basic version there is only the least number of effects and etc., so this app can be used only by rich peoples..😠",0

Photo Editor,So much fun! I'm a photographer and I love what all this can do just playing with it. It's like a game and really addictive. Glad I got it! A month later and I've added more photography apps but I keep going back to this one. Simple to use and the effects are better than the more complicated apps.

Photo Editor,"Useful features, helpful so far, but just now as we're trying to get our baby to sleep one of the ads from this app blasted really loud about paying too much for car insurance. I understand using visual ads to monetize your app but permitting ads with audio is intrusive and shows a lack of concern for your users. And their woken up babies.",0
Photo Editor,wow this is not your typical editor of things but it's too big even to tell you about. yes a much needed app check it out now,1
Snapseed,"Snapseed is by far the most useful and efficient photoshopping app I've seen. It introduces lots of options on editing, which a lot of other apps lack. The only thing that bothers me is the layout of the interface itself. We are not allowed to save the edited photo as a draft, which makes it annoying to start over rather than where you left off. I am hoping for updates and development, but so far this app is brilliant.",1
Snapseed,"Simply the best free photo editing app for Android. Mobile phone or tablet you need this! Just remember not to over edit your photos too much as this can lead to lots of artifacts creeping in to your pictures. Generally I transfer photos from my DSLR to my tablet, turn up the brightness (not too much mind) and edit away. My most used features are : details, hdr, tune image and crop. Why not give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",1
Snapseed,"it was a very good app until recently. it's not being updated much. and the last update has a serious issue, at least for me. it's being closed completely from recent apps, so it has become impossible to switch between apps and no it's not my ram issue 'cause I'm using OP3 with 6gb ram. even an accidental touch on the recent apps button closes the app instantly.",0
Snapseed,I used to use this app once.. It was one of the best app i used so far. But I'm ranking it because it has some issues that i have been facing since i bought a new phone of Xiaomi Note 5 AI. When ever i try to save or export a photo into my device it doesn't want to save it and this app closes it self then i have to start the app from beginning. All the time that i used to edit all goes to waste. There is no option to fix this i tried many method.,0

Adobe Photoshop Express:Photo Editor Collage Maker,"it's good to a point. I understand the limits of each app but still lacks some basic functions for eg- sketch won't allow a 90⁰ rotation to help work on projects. having a landscape image that can't be viewed in landscape is very annoying. having to export it to PE just to rotate the image and then saving, opening again in sketch just to view it sideways. also something what should be simple but isnt is the cutting out and overlaying on layer image is another arduous task.",1
Adobe Photoshop Express:Photo Editor Collage Maker,I would give it 5 stars if PS can process HEIF format - some android phones can now capture in HEIF format (Samsung in my case). PS can show the thumbnail of HEIF (identified it as RAW though) but cannot process it. Adobe's Lightroom CC app can process HEIF! (and so can Snapseed for that matter). I'm baffled as to why 2 apps from the same company cannot have the same file format compatibility.,0
Adobe Photoshop Express:Photo Editor Collage Maker,Pros: - Great features and easy to use. - Wide range of filters and LIGHTING EFFECTS along with excellent correction tools. - Cons: - One thing which is missing is the SELECTIVE TOOL which can be used to customize the area on which you want the specific effect. - There is no ERASE TOOL. Erase tool can come handy when you want to remove the unwanted objects from the image.,1
Adobe Photoshop Express:Photo Editor Collage Maker,"actually, i should have mentioned, there are several places where entering digits is much easier to achieve than moving my fat thumb over the phone screen (for accuracy). actually these are requirements, the only way to achieve useful accuracy out off the colour profile is by using digit and thumb entry eg: slide the thumb across the colour until you find the correct color number, enter the right for saturation, repeat this for the second entry and wallah! accuracy.",0

Cut Paste Photo Editor,Way too many ads. Could not to anything in the app without either a banner ad blocking workspace or a full screen ad that I had to sit through. Ended up uninstalling before even being able to get used to the app.,0
Cut Paste Photo Editor,Once I was able to see what each feature does it was easy and fun to use. I created some AMAZING invitations and pictures. I've shared app with friends and family already.,1
Photo Editor,"If I knew ahead the uselessness if this app I wouldn't have wasted my time download it. The UI is a shamful design product. It suppose to have like any editor a SAVE function with a choice of image format. it didn't , also it would be nice like any other editor to have the functions handy in either a drop down menu or a bar one available instead of going on a hunt for it.",0

LightX Photo Editor & Photo Effects,"Really disappointed. I purchased the pro version of this app and now it's completely changed. It now requires the permission ""run at startup"" which is not necessary for any app that isn't a system app. Unless you've rooted your device one can not deselect this option. it also forces you to except their privacy policy to open it , but when you select the privacy policy you get a blank screen. So you agree to something you can't read, for an app that starts without your permission. Bad Form!",0

Photo Editor All,"This app is terrible, I wouldn't recommend this to ANYONE! It is very laggy, and pops up far to many adds. It even popped up a virus! I don't know who would ever create an app like this, it's TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE!!!🙅🙅😬",1

Image Editor,"Great app...does what I want, for the most part anyway, but what's new? You fail to show a changelog on Google Play. Why is the app updating constantly, sometimes even multiple updates a day?!?",1
Image Editor,"honestly, this app might not be the most beautiful editor on the web, but it is imo by far the most useful. It can be a bit clumsy sometimes, but it will always offer you a solution for what you want to do (unless it's like really advanced photoshop stuff). I always felt limited in other apps but this one is just doing what its supposed to be. Thank's developer guy :)",1
Image Editor,"This is it. This is the definitive image editor on Android. It's not visually impressive, but it has EVERY feature I need for making memes or doing general image manipulation, like copy, text, resizing, layers, custom fonts, etc., none of which is locked behind a paywall. Very good visual feedback on area selection, too! This is an immediate 10/10 from me. Thank you so much for this app!",1
Image Editor,"i love this app. why is its rating so low?! these kids want funny face filters or something? it's perfect. does everything. to anyone reading this, disregard rating, download now",1

"Photo Editor, Filters for Pictures - Lumii","Beautiful finishing touch to every artistic photo. However, I would suggest adding an option to be able to choose compression settings. The resulting files are huge. Learn from Snapseed - their output (95% JPEG) is of perfect quality/size ratio. At the moment I have to resave some of your outputs.",1
"Photo Editor, Filters for Pictures - Lumii","I'm am completely mad with LUMII, this update is superb. But one thing is missing Blur tool with eraser, I request for giving us blurness tool",1

Smorowski",1
"Pretty Makeup, Beauty Photo Editor & Selfie Camera",I really like being able to color the lips and the way to edit the eyes however the models that keep appearing in my gallery because it's the suggested ones is really really incredibly annoying and frusting. I would rather like it if every time I made an edit or whatever I didn't have those three models appearing in my gallery. I have enough photos as is.,1
"Pretty Makeup, Beauty Photo Editor & Selfie Camera",Great application I have got a few great pictures of the new Makeup I'd like to try out this is really easy to use and you can get a good idea of what's going to suit you and what doesn't seem to work for your complexion I've found this also useful for the times you need a photo but haven't gotten your makeup done I've tried several of these applications and I have got to say that this is the best quickest and easiest way to get the Makeup look and theirs no eye shadow stickers etc to deal with,1
"Pretty Makeup, Beauty Photo Editor & Selfie Camera","Good make up app, easy to use, and doesn't ask for access to things it doesn't need on the phone. It does a much better job of makeup than snap chat. Adds to access other filters are only 5 seconds long. Good choice of apps.",1
"Pretty Makeup, Beauty Photo Editor & Selfie Camera",It was interesting I liked lip sticks the best but maybe you can make the foundation more full coverage the face recognition a bit better and make the accerories more realistic Over all its 2 stars from me,0

Cartoon Photo Editor,"There is one feature that I really like which is the only reason I put up with the bombardment of ads between each and every different action you do on this app. Never have I seen an app impose so much advertising while in use. It's a drag. It's annoying and Im making mental notes of what NOT to buy. Basically if an ad interrupts me I will not buy. I can see when you open the app or have been on it for awhile, throw an add in. But an add between each and every action on the app? No. I I hate that",1
Cartoon Photo Editor,i dont understand. it worked great on my old phone. i installed it on my new one and the graphics are really bad with unessesary lines that didnt have before.,0

Men Suit Photo Editor 2019,"Became Very worst after updated.Few months back once up on time i used this very comfort and easy to edit work .Now became worst not at all comfort to drag ,move very uneasy with lot of stupid ads always .Old version only comfort .When we upload pic showing too much close and icons are disturbing half of the space using icons with double rows and very little place only available to drag suit so not comfort not even single photo also cant set correctly.",0

Art Filter Photo Editor & Pic Art Painting Effects,Great app! Have been having a great time playing with all the cool effects. Not the usual boring filters so many photo apps use. Love it! Okay okay minus one star. Getting a little annoyed with the annoying ads. Would be 5 stars if could remove them for a small fee.,1
Art Filter Photo Editor & Pic Art Painting Effects,"Edit: why give us more styles and the choice to save favourites but reset the our selected ones with every update? Add that to the constant adverts & changing the names of all the filters for no reason, it would seem you are intent on ruining a great app. Dropped rating to 2 stars. really liked the filters but a barrage of ads has ruined a great app. i would happily consider paying for an ad free version. also sometimes unable to use at peak times as it processes the pictures online.",0
Art Filter Photo Editor & Pic Art Painting Effects,I like it has pretty cool effects/filters it would improve even a bad pix making it look interesting!! Just applay different filters to your photo until the desired look is achieved. Could take some time until one gets the final look but is worth it!!! I think.... Needs more options perhaps how to individually manipulate colors to create half tones or duo tones???,1
Art Filter Photo Editor & Pic Art Painting Effects,boring! ever time I tried to crop it would go straight back to the original size. shows very flaw in ur face. makes the person look very old and it's not flattering to anyone no matter the age. did nothing like it said it would.,0
Art Filter Photo Editor & Pic Art Painting Effects,"When I first downloaded the app, I loved it. The filters were great, and I could watch a video ad to remove the watermark. I was going to give the app 4 stars, but they seem to have removed the ability to remove the watermark, and there is no paid version. Big raspberry. Call me if you come out with a paid version or some way to remove the watermark.",0
Art Filter Photo Editor & Pic Art Painting Effects,Very useful app except only the watermark it's very big and covering the whole picture more than the faces in the picture..Not flexible for free users that means have to go for PRO...So now if i want the perfect picture need to pay?Totally end of all no use for free.. And Thank God about that choice 'watching the add and remove the watermark'(it's too for evey picture)otherwise i w'd uninstall it immediately ther's no use makin pict. but Still useful.Very useful application.Thank you Developers.,1

Mirror Photo Editor: Collage Maker & Selfie Camera,"The app does what it says, but there is a disproportionate amount of ads per action. Upload a pic? Ad first. Mirror an image? Ad first.

Blend Me Photo Editor,"you get a few ugly backgrounds but to get the good ones you have to watch video to unlock the new background you want. after you watch it, it will not give you the background. you watch all these ad videos for nothing. would be a good app if you could actually get some good backgrounds. dont waste your time watching ad videos for nothing.",0
Blend Me Photo Editor,Not doing what is expected of the app. It has too many hickups. At one point i was able to get more then one picure blended but the next minute it doesn't. It never let me have my own backround to blend with my pictures.,0
Blend Me Photo Editor,"I was ask to rate the app. it wont let me it takes me to review the app. well i love it but dont ask me to one thing then force me to another. Do you know how COMMUNISM WORKS??Now your forcing me to change what I said here. NO IM NOT CHANGING ONE WORD. SO EITHER POST OR DON'T POST, BUT WHAT EVER YOU DO ,,,, DON'T EVER ASK ME AGAIN OR I WILL TO A REVIEW AND PUT IT WHERE YOU HAVE NO CONTROL. 🖕",0

Ultimate Photo Editor,"I've used other cropping applications that produce image quality much better, why is it that the picture quality is so poor once the crop is done. I made a comparison, this app is terrible and no options for quality of the final picture.",0
Ultimate Photo Editor,"Im gonna uninstall. Note to developer, putting a big ass watermark on photos pretty much defeats the editing. Your app contains ads. WHY ADVERTISE ON MY GIRLFRIENDS FACE!?",0
Ultimate Photo Editor,"Quite good for editing photos on the fly. I wish we could shrink, enlarge, rotate and fade stickers and option to buy sets of more stickers. ?",1
Ultimate Photo Editor,it doesnt do what it advertises. it shows a paintbrush but there isnt one in the app. no good. didnt like it. its basic stuff that you can do on facebook w/o using up phone storage. uninstalled right away.,0
Ultimate Photo Editor,No sooner than I started the application got hit with an ad which to me is an automatic uninstall since you can't even start it without getting slammed with an ad you know that they're going to be annoying and intrusive so I don't bother..,0
Ultimate Photo Editor,"It's easy, has many choices, works great. I might have to use this before I post any picture of me.",1

PhotoGrid Lite: Photo Collage Maker & Photo Editor,Love this lite version because making collage is all I need. Edited: no more loud and noisy ads.,1

Photo Editor PRO,"I have another app that I use which is JUST as great as this one! The difference I like between this and THAT one is the other one just has too many pop-up ads, which is extremely annoying and this one I can enjoy the editing experience a lot more. I don't mess with ""funny"" or ""cute"" filters, so this is one of my favorite apps to use! Thank you!",1
Photo Editor PRO,"I used Aviary since I was 14 (am 22 now) and this is the closest thing I can find to that wonderful app. still not the greatest, but very close to a mock up of the real thing. will be switching over to this app because apparently Aviary has been trashed by some a**hat for the mere profit of it, but I wont br switching happily /=",0
Photo Editor PRO,Best photo editor app for free out there! I have used it for 2 years and have always had the best photos! I can easily remove large and tiny blemishes and straighten to a perfect square. I highly recommend this app! Thanks so much for this app and keep up the good job!!!,1
Photo Editor PRO,"thanks so much! I have this picture of my husband and I when we first started dating and it was from an old flip phone, needless to say it was horribly pixelated. thanks to this app I was able to enhance it and smooth the lines. I was also able to asjust the color and brighten it up so it wasn't so dark. absolutely amazing like having it professionally fixed without the cost. keep up the good work!!",1
Photo Editor PRO,"100% Back in my happy now thanks to you. It was a very frustrating week because I had a 'Photo editor for Android, app that was similar and they went and changed it on me. mad boi. I'm glad I found this one. I'll be sure to tell my friends!!!! Thx",1
Photo Editor PRO,I just downloaded and used your editing tools on a picture I really like but the picture wasn't very clear I've tried a number best way to sharpen the picture but nothing ever worked. now I have another favorite wallpaper for my phone. your app works excellent on my Samsung j7,1
Photo Editor PRO,"So far the app is great! The blemish tool is incredible, and I was able to make my photo look much much better than it did! And I also enjoyed the enhancing feature, it gave the photo a whole new look, as well as the HD feature which really made it look great! I will absolutely keep using this app to edit my pictures. Thank you so much for making such a wonderful app, you did an awesome job!!!",1
Square InPic - Photo Editor & Collage Maker,"Excellent and simple to use app that has everything I need to edit pictures. I can crop, add text, zoom, flip, and more , plus when I'm done I can share directly from the app. The Gui is easy to understand and use. It has a short ad while saving - I would have given the app 5 stars if I had the option to pay to remove the ad.",1
Square InPic - Photo Editor & Collage Maker,"So far so good. Helps create borders; crops; zooms and even flips images. Plus, it's user friendly. A few ads here and there and not the most intuitive - check your borders don't go auto-funky colours. Thank you!",1
Square InPic - Photo Editor & Collage Maker,"This is a pretty good app; I've been using it for a few of years now to add a blurred background to square cropped images and also a watermark. The adjustment tools for images (brightness, contrast, etc.) were also very useful when my default photo editor was updated and these basic and crucial features removed. Practically my only complaint relates to how the text tool works. This app does more than I expected it to, and for that I'm glad!",1
Square InPic - Photo Editor & Collage Maker,some glitch is causing it to zoom in whenever a filter/adjustment is made. no matter if its been cropped or not and there's no changing it back once it's done this.,0
Square InPic - Photo Editor & Collage Maker,nice app i always size my pics by this only i have this app in my 3 phone it is simple and easy to use and fast working app,1
Square InPic - Photo Editor & Collage Maker,It's a really good app...really loved it....it's going to be the most usable app.. according to me all will love it,1
Photo Editor & Perfect Selfie,"The old version was better. I updated it recently and new version can't reshape small things now when old version absolutely can. Photos will be resized too much and have low quality. Hope you guys fix it asap, thanks!",1
Photo Editor & Perfect Selfie,this app helped me alot. I have am issue with my hair looking lopsided in photos but I was able to subtly use the smudge tool to make it look even thus making me look better. the only thing it lacks is the ability to move my jaw to be more in the middle,1
Photo Editor & Perfect Selfie,"Photo Editor is using 34.91 GB of storage on my Samsung Galaxy s8+ phone. This is far more than any other app, in fact it is more than all the other apps combined (13 GB). Everyday I have to move files to my external storage card in order to have enough storage for my phone to operate properly and i wouldn't have to be doing this on a daily basis if this app wasn't using up so much of my storage. I sent an email 5 days ago asking for help with this but I haven't heard anything back from them.",0
Photo Editor & Perfect Selfie,"been using for yrs. I pay annually for a simple, yet powerful ease of use app. quick photo edits that look better thn the pros! My only complaint ovr the yrs clip art same ones 3yrs! sucks! like u gave up! I've used both apps religiously 2gthr multiple × a day. Media is my business & use in leisure. It's looking like I'll have to perm. uninstall both apps now since the latest update I no longr have full use of editing the font/s. color/s. Vry no good! As I constantly use this tool. uninstld 2x!",0
Photo Editor & Perfect Selfie,I don't like it anymore it is reducing pic's size after saving. It is of no use now. It used to save pictures in same quality before and there was an option of picture qualities (to save in). Why you did this ?,0
Photo Editor & Perfect Selfie,Reduces the quality and the dimensions of the output image. Fix now! Adope Photoshop and Lightroom keep the same quality and dimensions of the output image.,0
Photo Editor & Perfect Selfie,Installed to use red eye removal. Followed instructions and nothing happens other than it asking if I want to share my creations. Tried several times and nothing ever happened when I used it. Pointless having an editor app that doesn't edit!,0
Photo Collage Maker - Photo Frame Editor,"It helped me to make a super cute collage of my dogs and boyfriend. I really recommend this app because its super cute and easy to use. Rotating the photos is kinda weird, but other then that its so great. Thank-you!",1

Military Man Photo Editor,"it's needs a major update, this would good 10 yrs ago.. to many pop ups",0
Military Man Photo Editor,whenever I try to put the face on it it doesn't fit it keeps on turning and I could not adapt the head to the military suit because the cropped head is too big and there is no way to make it smaller to fit it on the suit... it sucks! the cropped head keeps on zooming and turning and there is no way it fits the Military suit. this is the worst application I have ever tried eversince!!!,0
Military Man Photo Editor,I'm disappointed. The photos are very difficult to match with the suits. The app doesn't have an intuitive interface and I had to hunt and peck trying to get a photo out of my gallery. No tutorial either. Got frustrated and uninstalled.,0
Military Man Photo Editor,it's the bomb get it got it keep it it's yours,1
Military Man Photo Editor,it sucks!!! you can not control the head (resizing and trying to place it ) it keeps on turning. need ultra major repair!!!,0

"photo PIP, photo editor","Where is all your shapes n patterns for this PIP, use back the own one which is very good to post our photos on it, it is very useful than now new one is no good n very hard to find a place for our photos to add into... Actually is to use back all in ONE is better than to change to a new type of things which is very troublesome, please look into this app, Thank You.",1
"photo PIP, photo editor",It's a great app. Its easy to work. I recommend downloading it. Although they could add a few more PIP effects. Other than the effects part. It's a great app.,1
"photo PIP, photo editor",I found it really amazing than the old one... try it once u are also gonna love it .... I tried so many apps but this is the best one😎😎😎😎 yaya!! finally I got a cool app😍😍 yo!!,1

Telly,if it was possible to give this rating of 0 * I would honestly this is really bad to do not buy it they have no American movies like in English that's what I meant about American movies like what I don't even like this app why did I even download it do not download this app is horrible download something more professional that's what I'm about to do,0
Telly,"The worst app ever , I did a mistake by installing it years ago and deleted after few months yet since then they keep deducting money from my visa card . Tried calling ,emailing with no response . Ther stupid app has no feature of stopping my subscription. I even contacted my mobile company to help me stop this stupid thing but no luck ",0

Telly,good app for movie download this app,1

Telly,"has a bug needs to fix ,unfortunatelly every time open the App it crushes right away although i tried to clear cash and force stop ,but nothing helps .",0
Telly,Useless app ever,0
MovieBase,Wow... really impressive app. So well though on every front. Why does it have so few downloads? This is the best movie organizer atm. The top bar shouldn't dissapear tho (on every page) when scrolling.,1
MovieBase,"Don't waste your time downloading, ever movie that I clicked on goes straight to YouTube for the movie trailer and does NOT play the movie!",0
MovieBase,"The app is really good but I am unable to synchronise few Indian TV shows from my Trakt account. I can choose any Indian shows from this app and put them in my watchlist, but i cannot synchronise this progress to my trakt account. Please fix this as early as possible.",1
MovieBase,Worked as intended. But widget support is very very imp as I don't want to check in by opening app everytime. So dropped 2 stars.,0
MovieBase,The best ! I was looking for an app that show the movie collection of the movie ,1
MovieBase,You need a premium version to use trakt with this! sucks without it. They should say this right at the top of the app description in bold!! It displays good info from TMDB though,0
MovieBase,great way to keep track of Media to watch or find more shows and movies. syncs with trakt and tmdb which is awesome!,1
MovieBase,"An otherwise good and promising app ruins itself with incredibly small interface buttons making any attempt to use it frustrating and almost not worth the bother, considering the market of alternatives available. Worst of all, it's an unnecessary (and poor) design choice since there is ample space for larger buttons. Maybe they just want to mock individuals with Parkinson's?",0
MovieBase,people are not I think I should have been there with them but they are worse for me and I was about the last time they got me to Brian the day they went on the road with me to get dressed up in the morning when I can see them again and then we got the car back on the road and they went to my bestfri...Full Review,1
MovieBase,Horrible it takes me to the trailer of any movie would rate it 0 stars for sure,0
MovieBase,"Excellent!! I love this app, it solved my issue of not keeping track of what I own.",1
MovieBase,Does this app have a default ui theme or is it somehow randomized? I had this installed on another device and it had a light theme and on this one it has a dark theme. I considered buying it but the fact that it varies among my devices for no discernable reason puts me off me a bit.,0
MovieBase,I have just started using the app and loved it. So much so that I have already bought the premium features. I hope the dev team keep maintaining the app.,1
MovieBase,"great app, so good I upgraded to be able to move around some of the home page listings to show my own personalized preferences. great interface and does both tv (breaks down seasons & episodes) and movies! perfect app. exactly what I was looking for!",0
MovieBase,Excellent movie/tv tracking app. I've tried several others and this one works best for me. Definitely one I'm looking to purchase in the future.,1
MovieBase,"One of the main reasons I paid in app, was because I liked having all ratings in one place. With the removal of RT and Metacritic this app has no use for me now.",0
MovieBase,really helpful for me. i like this app. previously i used film closet on my Windows mobile which using tmdb database. this app also using tmdb database so i just login using my tmdb id and got all my list.,1
MovieBase,"For a month's time, the app's content is not loading if i am using Wi-fi, but works fine in Mobile data. Can you please look into this?",0
MovieBase,his app is changing my card I want it to end,0
Hobi,"Would be 4 stars if there was an option to archive shows, allowing only the shows you are currently watching to be visible, whilst saving others for later. Would be 5 stars if there weren't so many ads pestering me to Go Premium.",0
Hobi,"So far very satisfied, keeping track of the shows I'm watching, very useful to keep track on which episode you 're on and having basic info. Well designed app, minimal, easy on the eye. Huge collection of shows, everything I searched I found.",1
Hobi,premium account doesnt restore and dev doesnt respond to email... edit: i just updated the app and premium was gone...F.Y.I my premium was activated using share may e thats y restore didnt work.,0
Hobi,"it's really good, for me is the best for tracking my shows, the only downside is that they don't have a calendar widget. you always have to check the app or wait for the notification. hope the will add it as feature in the upcoming updates.",1
Hobi,"I first wrote a nice review but since then I found out that the notifications only come to the device which used Hobi last, not to all devices. Apparently it’s to be added at some point in the future, when is another question. Also I bought their lifetime premium to be able to customise the option « when to notify » but none of the options work. I have to use their pre-set options to get the notifications which makes my purchase worthless. Still waiting to hear from the developers",0
Hobi,"Extremely disappointing that there is no ability to track movies, only series. Every info is funneled thru TrakTv, so it shouldn't be that time consuming to implement to display movies too. Other than that Moviebase is overall a better app, much more organizing tools there. (Like custom lists that can be saved) But for a minimalistic series tracker Hobi is the best option on the market. A little brighter skin would be nice. (not white! Just some brighter that plain black.)",1
Hobi,"Really nice feature to track currently 'watching' shows. If possible, can you add a personalized profile so we could see watched, watching and watchlist section. I have a few of my friends that have this app but we can't directly see each other watching activities. Having a profile could help user to socialize more with each other and hopefully grow to a better community. Really hoping that you can take this into consideration. thanks",0
Hobi,"I love this app so much, makes it so easy to keep track of my many shows and live that it shows the statistics for how many hours watched etc. The only disappointing thing is it syncs to Trakt but you can't say that you've watched an episode multiple times. This feature would be really appreciated and make the app perfect.",1
Hobi,"I love the app and pay for premium yearly (when it was offered for $4.99/year), but now it is advertising premium to me again for $7.99/yearly (or $9.99 lifetime) and thats annoying. I already pay, stop trying to make me pay again",0
Hobi,Does keep up well with Trakt account. Good UI. Some shows dont include Specials episodes. Would love to see the inclusion of movie tracking in this app instead of having to use multiple,1
Hobi,i don't understand how to start watching the show and is rhis just a traker app. please add more instructions abd I'll be waiting for a reply on how to watch a show ob this app,0
Hobi,"t has great potential (best UI out there) but it needs a few more features like TV show groupings (For Later, Ended etc) and it certainly needs at least some basic Show information. The premium pricing is also on the expensive side with so much competition on the market. It's one of the 3 apps I have installed to see if it fulfills its potential.",1
Hobi,"Good app, desperately needs an upcoming episodes widget so i can see a schedule for the week without having to dig through the app. Basically, copy tvshowtime's upcoming widget, their app ui is getting worse and worse and i really want to switch to hobi.",0
Hobi,"So far I am liking it, however I would like to see release dates by subscription. For instance, I don't have Starz or HBO, but I would like to see the release dates for Netflix, Hulu and Prime. Tried to read the reviews or even figure out if this was a paid feature, but nothing tells me so.",1
Hobi,"Hi, season specials for a lot of shows are not visible. Maybe look into that?",0
Hobi,"Very simple but also very useful — in fact, outclassing in usefulness the competition. You don't need to register an account — just list the series to be monitored. When notified, you are not presented with a calendar view — just a list of episodes to come in declining order of days due, and if nothing is due the list is simply empty.",1
Hobi,"Great app, especially as I don't have Sky TV, this app lets me know when new episodes and new series of my favourite shows are airing, including Netflix. Only downside is some info is USA based so earlier air dates than the UK. Still worth the 5* rating for a free app though.",1
Hobi,"No widget, no recently aired section, and no way to separate or group shows to make it easier to track only those actively being watched. Way too basic to be of much use.",0
Hobi,"UI is superb! What makes it kind of useless for me, is that I cannot select a date when watched, for shows I watched earlier.",0
Google ,"every other update does something to unsync my syncronicity. back and forth, good then back, love the google then hate the google. my watch is not connecting. google, you should be ashamed of yourself, you made a cloud frown. like they aren't sad enough as it is.

foodpanda - Local Food Delivery,App will actually be perfect if you work on these 2 things: Order tracking on the app is useless. Not accurate at all. I hope that you can add a feature to the app where we can be able to chat directly with the rider because the chat support on the app is of no use as well when I want to know the real time status of the rider.,0
foodpanda - Local Food Delivery,"TOTAL DISASTER. I ordered (delivery) on a fastfood using this app but got a notification that they cancelled on me. So, I decided to order a take out on a local restaurant near me. After doing so, I received a call from the fast food that they are already in my vicinity to hand me my order. I can't cancel my order from the local restaurant because it was a cook as you order type of place, and also the fast food because it was not their fault. In the end I paid twice for my diner.",0
foodpanda - Local Food Delivery,I ordered two milkshakes on free delivery and the approximate time was about half an hour.I was waiting anxiously for my order but 4 hours passed away and my order was not delivered yet.I complaint for the delay.They said that sorry for the delay now your order will be free and you don't have to pay for it.Suddenly my order cancelled and I didn't get it That was the worst service I have had ever!!!,0
foodpanda - Local Food Delivery,The app was working perfectly fine until I decided to update it! Ever since the update nothing has been happening other than getting an error message which says something went wrong. Please don't release updates if it has bugs that prevents the app from working.,0
foodpanda - Local Food Delivery,"If you're looking for terrible customer service, you've come to the right place. Their live chat will be one of the most excruciating things you'll have to deal with. From a simple problem of a rider forgetting to pick up food (which can be resolved easily and immediately), the staff will give you an extremely difficult time - which would result in 2-3 hours of live chat just to get a refund because apparently apparently asking for redelivery is an impossible task to the staff of Food panda.",0
foodpanda - Local Food Delivery,"It looks more like a lottery: every time you place your order you have no idea whether a restaurant will accept it or not. The worst thing that restaurants usually cancel the order in the last minute so you are just sitting for about 30-40 minutes and waisting your time. And it can be several times in a row (and it was). Terrible user experience, will think twice before ordering here next time",0
foodpanda - Local Food Delivery,"Today I decide to write the review. I ordered and my phone switched off due to my handphone battery problem, ive tried so many times to switch on but still it continues to switch off, I clearly put my level floor and my house number there so no need to call me anymore because I know my phone have this kind of problem. They suddenly cancel my order ! This is what im angry about, They said they will refund, and now?? Im waiting, and emailing them today, they said no refund initiate. GIVE MY MONEY!!",0
foodpanda - Local Food Delivery,This app really a win-win situation for both somebody who lazy to go buy food & those really helpful riders who make money by doing food delivery. To FoodPanda Riders please ride safely & take cover during heavy raining we definitely have patient for your service. Thank you abang rider Melayu India.,1
foodpanda - Local Food Delivery,"Worst app! Dont pay it by online transfer...i used online transfer for payment,then the restaurant cancel my order...they didn't inform you any refund...you need to contact them to inform n ask for the refund byself...after i inform to customer service by apps,they said that they will refund to my account within 2-7 working days...after 3days i didn't received any refund...n i contact them back by email...a month later..nothing!!!!!im used it for many times already...until this happen ...enough!!",0
foodpanda - Local Food Delivery,"It's unreliable -- don't bet ypur dinner on it. Sometimes the order works, sometimes it doesn't but at least customer service makes it right, and sometimes it never delivers your food without apology. This last case is getting more frequent -- 2 of my last 3 orders were rejected -- one after a 13 minute delay and one after a rediculous 45 minute delay. Foodpanda sersiously needs to fix their infrastructure -- if a restaurant is closed, why are you taking orders for it?",0

Food & Beverage Dictionary,"This is a very useful app, I would give it 5 stars as an app if there was a quicker way of navigating the menus. There must be a host of other information that could be added, it would be nice from a selfish point of view to see more dishes that are common in the UK added. But well done so far.",1
Food & Beverage Dictionary,Great App for who related to the food and beverage industry,1

SoundCloud - Music & Audio,"I've been using Soundcloud for years as a listener and as time has gone by there has been a lot more ads and they're very restricting. With some ads, if you tab out while the ad is playing, it will pause, forcing you to essentially watch the ad. I haven't seen an ad where you can skip it in a long time either. There's a bunch of bugs now such as not being able to go to the next song or pause the current song on your lock screen. Definitely not what it use to be.",0
SoundCloud - Music & Audio,I am getting increasingly frustrated with the app. I hit shuffle on my likes and it will play 1-3 songs and freeze up and I HAVE to restart my phone just to get it working again. I've been using sound cloud for over 8 years now and never had a problem until about a week ago and if it does not get fixed soon I'm about to cancel my membership that I've been paying for since the memberships started and going else where.,0
SoundCloud - Music & Audio,"how does an app like radio paradise, that doesn't make nearly as much money, have android auto support and you guys still havent figured it out? what the hell is wrong with you idiots?! I cant even talk about all the positives of this app because I cant look past this. I've been using this app for a really long time, hoping the devs would pull their heads out of their asses. I guess that's asking too much.",0
SoundCloud - Music & Audio,sound cloud is a great app for listening to the music you like while in the GO. as well the audio is better than the other apps I've tried. the reason I gave 3 stars us because to listen to all your favourite songs you must pay 10$ monthly or you only get partial parts of songs or nothing at all. so in the end I believe that sound cloud is a great app and a lot more people should use it and recommend it.,1
SoundCloud - Music & Audio,"The complexity of this app goes beyond space and time touching the cosmos by applying the greatest music of all time, and I highly reccommend the use of this app for any Emo's, Cool kids, Mumble rappers, and millennials. Being the cool kid I stay on the top 50 section which contains high quality before fame music. Also there's alot of toxic people so beware of those but other than that 11/10. Oh yeah follow me on soundcloud, my name is herecomethatboi ""mic drop"".",1
Music Player - Audio Player,its pretty and good but it just lack a little bit of control of the lyrics section. you have to search and save from the google first. i suggest that you guys should change the lyrics system as the stellio one. its more convenient than yours though. well i hope you consider my suggestion.,0

Music Player - Audio Player with Sound Changer,"What a fantastic Music App. I was thinking about buying Neutron Music App. But this App is More Sweeter than that. Really I am not used to easily satisfy with music quality. But this app made me to write these words. If you want to enjoy a music with the taste the musician want deliver, then this is for you. Though I am not an audiophile , I want to enjoy it in a decent quality. for that it really satisfy me. Thanks for the developer. After updated today (19-12-2018) the sound effect changed to Echo. I want to enjoy natural sound that was produced by this app before updated.",1
Add Music to Voice,"I've gotta say this exceeded my expectations. I expected a halfass app that was annoying to work with but this is easy as pie and the sound is perfect - the setup is easy and you can customize as much as you want to.

Dub Music Player - Audio Player & Music Equalizer,"BEST OF THE BEST . please without the ads, you will spoil the best player in the world. I've tested all the pleyers that exist for android smartphones. The DUB MUSIC PLAYER has the highest quality and loudest sound, beautiful looks, is so small and very powerful. I would like to have more visual effects and visualization can be viewed over the entire screen. Whoever installs it will not complain.",1
Dub Music Player - Audio Player & Music Equalizer,"This the best player I ever used EXCELLENT! It does everything a player has to do and what I want it to do. Love theme packages, easy of use and beautiful interface. I have deleted all other players on my phone I have found the one I was looking for.

Dub Music Player - Audio Player & Music Equalizer,i read another review posted... said something like bass booster is not good. It works good for me. Finally i can hear the bass in me drum & bass. at least 250 -500 watt amp. EXCELLENT bass boost. Did there used to be a skip silence option on a previous version?,1
Dub Music Player - Audio Player & Music Equalizer,"I just installed it and so far it looks great, it sounds great, but the best thing I like about it is that it doesn't download album art. I have over 20 GB of MP3s on my Android, and to have album art for all of this would take up an enormous amount of space, which Google play music insist that I have.",1
Dub Music Player - Audio Player & Music Equalizer,"I like this app because it does two things that other apps dont do: it remembers which ""song"" i was listening to and where in the track i was when i turned off the app, and also, it plays all the""songs"" in the correct alphanumerical order.",1
Dub Music Player - Audio Player & Music Equalizer,this is another excellent app I've actually got two on my phone bass booster & this one but I use this one all the time the other one's just for back up you get a brilliant sound even when your wearing wifi earbuds you can't go wrong with this app did I mention that the sound is amazing cheers girls & guys keep up the good work RJ,1
Dub Music Player - Audio Player & Music Equalizer,I use to love this app. It was my go to as a music player. However it now apparently is trying to listen in to the phone and will not run unless it gets acess to the mic. So long dub app it's been a good run.,0
Dub Music Player - Audio Player & Music Equalizer,Love the UI and the features but on my Moto G6 the volume from the speaker (and headphones socket) is either null or blaringly loud. I didn't even know the speaker went as loud. Sort this problem and you'll get 5 stars but until then it's sadly unusable for me so being uninstalled.,0
Dub Music Player - Audio Player & Music Equalizer,awesome app! badass that to unlock the adfree version all u have to do is invite 1 friend! RIGHT ON! THANKS FOR KEEPING IT SIMPLE AND FREE SO EVERYONE CAN ENJOY ADFREE MUSIC (UNLIKE MOST OF THE OTHER APPS OUT THERE)!!! 💚,1
Music Player - Audio Player with Best Sound Effect,"Great app, although it has one huge flaw which made me uninstall - the music played is slowed down and makes the sound one tone lower. It has an option to change the tempo of the songs played although changing it and then resetting to default did not fix it. Please fix and then I will re install. I recommended this app to my friend and he has the same problem. My phone: Meizu M6s His: Samsung Galaxy Edge (idk which model)",0
Music Player - Audio Player with Best Sound Effect,"Bad: No ripple/gain, hi sample rate Flac's don't reproduce as they should, no Opus support, doesn't pause when other sound source kicks in. Only Arm v7. Effects: 10 band EQ is rather good, but 1dB steps are to high, it's not enough for me anyway but it's adequate to what most other apps offer. The rest of the effects aren't really useful & there just to play with. The good: looks, interface, skins, sound signature (a bit on the warm side). Odd: old libx86bridge.so dynamic linking lib (generic)",1
Music Player - Audio Player with Best Sound Effect,"This music player is a big deal of scratch snitch sweeps and missed calculate levels of sounds, i was wounded! I had to rearrange the way music was read, but it was OK at the end, it was working at right speed and pitch, and the effects were also good.",1

I even tried other ones to compare and this is the best I've used, it's reliable, and it even lets you change song titles which I love cause I like to have my music look professional and etc. Download this! Also with people who are trying to find apps to search music, this is not for you, if you want to use downloaded music, this is definitely for you. Easy, neat and clean. Download this now!",1

When I click on an artist, I want the tracks separated by album and not alphabetically. So now I have to search an album. Very disappointed in this app.",0

Messenger Lite,"Edit: Unable to see photos in the app all the sudden. It's a decent app, but I do not like the recent update to add FB notifications to main page. If I wanted to see FB notifications, I would install the FB app. I would rather not be triggered by a notification flag for FB stuff that are not important. Please consider giving consumers the option to remove/deactivate.",0
Messenger Lite,"not bad, I love the love the concept of messenger without all the unnecessary stuff. however I do think some of the quality of life features should be implemented: I think that lite would benefit from fratures such as chat heads, picture editing, comment react & reply, custom ringtones, secret conversations, and the ability to share your current location. these all of these features are quality of life features that I think should be standardized on every chat or messaging application.",1
Messenger Lite,"It hardly ever connects to the internet whenever i open this App forget about getting push notifications!! I missed so many messages by a few days only because it never connects to the internet even though all my other Apps(e.g. Facebook) work just fine and i get push notifications from all other Apps except for this one. And no, i don't have any disruption in my internet connection. Not worth even one star.",0
Messenger Lite,I've found that reactions are really important in most of my conversations. Without reactions it seems just a bit TOO lite. You guys could also add an option if we want to see images or videos in HD. Oh and dark mode would also be great. update 2019/05/03.... yep this is still my comment,0
Messenger Lite,"no annoying and impossible to turn off 'chatheads' love that. no ads. love that. no annoying distracting icons trying to make you watch everyone's annoying 'stories'. no access to gifs but i'll take that absent feature wgen it means loosing all the totally unwanted nonsense found in the full, non lite Messenger app.",1
Messenger Lite,"Facebook has a very big problem when it comes to their software updates. Namely not telling users that updates will no longer work with their device and they have to downgrade to less efficient, less functional, less convenient ""stripped down"" lite software.",0
Messenger Lite,"Messenger Lite is a good Ap but recently I have been facing problem about the visibility of the pictures posted and received !! Every time I am asked to download the picture file from the given link !! This did not happen earlier !! Can you please help me to see the picture posts without the hassle of downloading, as before !! Thanks !!!",1
Messenger Lite,"Can't see photos in the app anymore. It displays a link with the filename and trying to download it does nothing because it's always a 0 KB file. This has been going on for over a week, is obviously a bug that many people are experiencing and needs to be fixed.",0
Messenger Lite,"For some awful reason recent updates destroyed the app. When someone post a picture, I cannot see it. Only the file file icon, and name. When I tap it, it says it gonna start dowloading, bur it never does. PLEASE FIX THIS!",0
Messenger Lite,"Very nice app, But a couple of things: 1: Whenever you want to call someone or video call them can you allow it so people can use their headphones or earbuds so yhey wouldn't have to unplug them everytime. 2: Sometimes whenever someone is active it glitches and then it doesn't show their active. 3: Most of the time the little icon for their profile is glitchy on the PC Version whenever they want to text people and it goes crazy. Thanks for making it easier for us.",1
Messenger Lite,"I use this in order to avoid the bloat of the main app. However, recently it seems that pictures in messages don't appear, instead only showing a file name. When you click it, it asks to download, but confirming does nothing. I'm entirely unable to see pictures now, which only bugs my friends using the full messenger app further. Not being able to see reactions is also a PITA. I'd love to migrate off Facebook entirely if I were able.",0
Messenger Lite,"I read some the recent reviews and I notice that I am having the same problem as many other users. I cannot veiw photos! When I click on a link that is most likely a photo, it says ""preparing to download"" and nothing happens. I uninstalled the app. and reinstalled and it worked like before....weird...",0
Messenger Lite,"I have run into an annoying problem with this app., but just one in the few months I've been using it so far. Two different people sent me the same photo and it came in as something I had to download, but the app. wouldn't let me to do it. I had to delete the app., then reload it again and then the photo showed up like they always did. Any other problems like that and I will never use this app. again.",0
Messenger Lite,This one works better for me other than the original which I used for 14+ years up until today when the update wouldn't take. People messaged me and I them but no one got any messages. So I saw this Lite version and downloaded it. At least it works. Only negative thing is no option to set a ringtone alert of my liking. I prefer to personalize my sounds. Ad that option and it'd be golden and I'd score it 5 stars. Personalized alerts are important to me,1
Messenger Lite,"Edit: For those having issues with the app, try uninstalling and reinstalling it. Worked for me. Clearing app cache wasn't enough. As I used the lite version, i came to appreciate how fast the app loads as well as the ability to reply to messages directly from the notification. Only one suggestion - dark mode please.",1
Messenger Lite,"Since the last update no picture, sent or received, can be viewed. Apparently I have the option to download them, but nothing happens. I always have to use the computer and the website to view the pictures. Has Facebook ever heard of 'testers'?",0
Facebook pages Manager,"Everytime a new update comes, something changes, usually not for the better. The last update won't allow me to like a comment as the page, or as myself. No option to comment as myself, only as the page, and not being able to like comments, is pointless having the app. Either sort these out in the next update, which is taking forever, or i will just delete the app, as its useless as it stands now.",0
Facebook pages Manager,"I use this app to manage my company/organization's Facebook page. It allows you to keep your pages in tact & updated without even using the FB app itself. You can update statuses, edit your page, receive notifications, read & reply to comments and a lot more. You can also link your instagram to the app & make posts thatll appear on both Instagram and your Facebook page. Perfect for if you own a business, run a organization or are a public figure. It works as the perfect tool to keep fans updated",1
Facebook pages Manager,"Notifications never go. Doesn't matter if you open all the unread notifications the counter on the front of the app never counts down. In other words you never know if the apparent number of 'new' notifications are real or just old ones. Must be a simple thing to fix, but here we are almost a year after I first installed it and it still does the same thing. Waste of time, so uninstalling",0
Facebook pages Manager,"HELP PLEASE! We have been enjoying this app for communicating with our customers, but for some reason right now I'm not able to like their responses. Will this be able to be fixed soon?",1
Facebook pages Manager,"I cannot share my own page posts to groups as my page...so am having to use my personal account which is annoying. can't send videos to customers via the private messaging. and I'm not able to initiate a private message with a person. they have to message me first, so I am constantly asking customers to PM me through my business Facebook page and not my personal Facebook account .",0
Facebook pages Manager,"Recently I realised that the app can display any pictures. It just blank! Another thing is the name of friend in Chinese always wrong. Sometimes missing 1 letter, sometimes wrong orientation. Hopefully this will be fix. And as I comment before, the sound messages cannot play.",1
Facebook pages Manager,"Page Manager ... the app that cannot manage anything. Can't edit scheduled videos, can't like visitor posts, can't view notifications of new comments, can't invite people who like your posts to like your page ... and the list goes on and on. This app used to do all of those things, but FB updates rendered it completely useless. You need a computer to actually manage a page now. This app is the PONG of apps, just as FB is the PONG of social media.READ ALL REVIEWS",0
Facebook pages Manager,"Randomly denies access to different areas (comments, notifications, etc). Also have to look at every notification twice for it to register that I looked at it. A ""mark all as read"" button would be nice. Overall, FB mobile is convenient to use, but very glitchy and frustrating. Using a 2 month old Samsung Note 9 on Verizon service. Had exactly the same issues on my previous phone, a Moto Z2 Force, same service. Edit: Now I can't react to comments on my pages. Fix this to bring my rating to 3 star",0
Facebook pages Manager,There is no way to manage multiple pages without logging in & out constantly. There needs to be a 2nd copy of the app like fb can to manage multiple accounts.,1
Facebook pages Manager,"This app is poorly design. When customers contact you via inbox, you don't always get notifications until you check your inbox on your own. Messages can be as late as 3 days late, making you lose customers and money. This app needs a serious revision. But nothing surprising here, every that Facebook does seems to be a catastrophe these days.",0
Facebook pages Manager,"This app constantly pisses me off. Where to start....notifications that never go away even after all have been viewed, messages that I can't access, constant sales pitches, annoying reminders that cant be turned off...and I'm sure there are more things that annoy me, but those are the worst. Also......",1
Facebook pages Manager,"Why in the world would you take the option to react to a comment out? The comments are now sorted by Most relevant, newest or all comments, when I select all comments, none of the new ones shows up, when I select newest none of the most relevant shows up, when I select most relevant only a few of the,this is very frustrating, the last update is horrible, I'm glad you fixed the albums problem but now this, Really? Once you fix these bugs I will rate you back to 4, for now you just get 1",0
Facebook pages Manager,Good Apps to manage my Pages without having to launch facebook app. The only thing is new update doesnt have LIKE button let alone other emotions button on post. Only left are reply & message button. And also unread comments sometimes unsearchable,1
Facebook pages Manager,"Unreliable. Nothing but problems with this app over the last few months, I no longer seem to receive notifications about anything despite settings being correct on my phone and in app, and new messages from my customers are not being shown when I try to load them up. Also had problems deleting old photos so basically the only thing it can do is post to my page.",0
Facebook pages Manager,very nice app it's super,1
Facebook pages Manager,keeps double posting so everything looks like I've posted twice.... really irritating..🙄🙄 19th April 19 update... now I've lost the ability to like someone's comment that they have taken the time to put on my page.... supposed to be able to interact with people... let them know you've seen and appreciated their comment.... the like button is just vanished from my posts... anyone else? silly to have this app available if you have to keep going in thru the Facebook page instea,0
Facebook pages Manager,"This app is ok. Could be better. Would love to be able to copy & paste emails as well as initiate contact/messages with people - this is HUGE! People ask for details on my post but i cannot initiate contact to provide details. Also, notifications do not go away even when I have read a msg. Really wish this was better.",0
Facebook pages Manager,great app very helpful!! can you guys please please fix the pictures order so the new ones pop up first and people dont have to scroll down to see the new pictures... im a tattoo shop and need people to see our newest work not the old. THANK YOU!,1
Facebook pages Manager,"Used to be a good app. Facebook constantly changes the app making it so you are able to do less with each update. You can no longer see the pages feed option for pages similar to yours, sharing has become glitchty and often fails, tagging never works correctly, and as of 4/15/19 you can't even like comments followers leave on your post. Better to save a lot of frustration and just use the mobile or desktop site instead.",0
Facebook pages Manager,"I used this app a few years ago until FB allowed us to admin from mobile devices. When I got my new tablet I didn't bother installing this app, however recently I have had issues as a page admin with notifications and unwanted activity on my community page so thought I would reinstall pages manager to get the insights and activity reports on my phone. Well according to this app I am not an admin of any pages, so it's 100% useless.",0

Shazam,"As soon as you open Shazam, the start-up is almost instant and then this app works fast. without hiccups. Online and offline this app is reliable and quickly responds to search requests with accurate results for almost every track it listens to. a suggestion for an extra feature in this app would be listening to spoken/sung lyrics and hymned tracks with a response of accurate results . If this app had this this feature and it worked well then I would've given the final star for a 5-star rating.",1
Shazam,"Don't think I've ever taken the time to actually write a review, sure I've rated an app by simply pressing the number of stars, but not this time ... This is the best app!! Love being able to go to my Shazam app and pretty much instantaneously find out exactly what song and artist I'm hearing, then it's automatically saved in Shazam!! This app truly never goes wrong!! Love it and Thank you!!!!!!!",1
Shazam,"""Can't"" ""Why?!"" ""Apple bought it.""... You used to be able to select from a few music services to hear the music after you had it identify a song. Now, you have to use Apple Music. Well, I would if they weren't so... Ya know, Apple. I have a $1,000 iPad that I can't download free apps onto bc Apple locks down your account if you have even $1 out somewhere. Even if it's because ""they want to run less card approvals now so they save up a few of your app purchases and then run everything at once.",0
Shazam,"App is on the higher end of music detection out of all apps available on Google Play (at least the free ones), note that it does contain adware however. Biggest gripe is the app has been throwing the ""Shazam is having trouble with Google Play services..."" any time I start it up or after updates (the app auto-starts itself after updates, making it easy to tell when it's auto-updated & running in the background), the only way to get rid of this error is to force stop it from your apps list...",1
Shazam,"Can you believe as a cross-over platform app, they only have a button for Apple music, not for Google Play music and Spotify. You can not change the default player. The only thing you can do is click, click, click, then play with other players! That is disgusting with Apple's market strategy! Uninstalled!",0
Shazam,"App is great, but don't like that it only takes you to Apple music. I don't use it and won't use it. Old app gave you choices between Google music, Amazon music and others to get the song you Shazamed. Oh well, hasn't stopped me from using the app though.",1
Shazam,"Be sure to turn off ALL app notifications! Especially the ""pop-up Shazam"", which is completely useless and constantly runs which will kill your battery! Also, every link for the songs is for apple music, also useless since the majority use Android platforms. You're welcome!",0
Shazam,"I enjoy using the Shazam app every day to discover new music and artists. The links to a relevant video and other related music tracks or artists are great, and makes for a satisfying user experience. Though not a music player, you can listen to a 30 sec music clip, which may be sufficient to help you find out if the track you are listening to, is the correct version. There are some issues, like not identifying known track or artist names at times, but Shazam is normally accurate enough.",1
Shazam,"I turned off a lot of permissions on Google Play services, especially the body sensor, and now I get a message popping up all of the time telling me that Shazam is having trouble because it doesn't have permissions, and it lists a long list, including the body sensor. What does Shazam need body sensors for? How invasive can you get? Don't answer that! Uninstalling!",0
Shazam,"One of my most used apps, identifying music is just a simple press of a button. Making it even better is using it on a Smart watch. It works on Wear OS but not on Samsung Tizen OS watches. Add a Samsung version and I will rave about Shazam to everyone!",1

Darkness Rises,Great RPG game with cool graphics and nice costumes. highly recommended its very addicting. it takes time and effort to be strong in this game. you need to have great patience dont rush things. just enjoy and have fun playing. good job nexon.. looking forward with great new things this next update.,0
Darkness Rises,"Dumpster-Fire: you know a game is trash when it lists ""character customization"" as one of its FOUR key features, but you can't choose your gender or weapon type. If you want a male character you HAVE to be a warrior or berserker. want a female berserker that uses maces? NO! berserkers are only male,",0
Darkness Rises,"awesome game but after character got lvl 12 it started kicking me out and locking up. i love this game but now after new patch I can't even play the game, i can only stay at main menu. After a week of reporting issues there has been nothing done to resolve these problems. Please fix this, i would lo",1
Darkness Rises,"I highly enjoy this game, the graphics and gameplay are very nice and it's very easy to pick up. But in saying this, I have run into two troubling problems on my main character. The first is when I have enough of my runes to upgrade but when I go to unequip the one that I need to upgrade, it says it",1
Darkness Rises,"I haven't managed to play the game yet because it keeps crashing! I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it twice and have cleared all the cached data my tablet has yet it still manages to constantly crash. The furthest I've got into this game was the ""Start Story"" bit. It's a shame because this game l",0
Darkness Rises,initially I enjoyed this game but I have quickly come to dislike it for one main reason: it is very transaction dependent to progress. In fact too much so. the gold acquisition is very hampered as is the necessary materials needed to go beyond the 4 million power mark. aside from random chest the on,1
Darkness Rises,"This game is now un-playable after the update. Everytime i want play the adventure stages, it closes on the loading screen. I have restarted, i have cleared ram, there is nothing running in the background, i have enough memory yet still, it closes on the loading screen of the game. This is really re",1
Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"The graphics are great and being able to create your own character is cool too. But the game is not engaging. It needs more actual ""GAME PLAY"" As far as I can tell dueling is about as challenging as it gets. The rest is just tapping until your energy is gone. At least give me a puzzle or something.",0
Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"I've just begun the Talbott SQ (Flying Solo) but the game keeps crashing as I want to go to the courtyard (Part 1 task 2). I've tried clearing my memory, rebooting the device and also clearing the cache, but it still doesn't work and the game is crashing as soon as it loads. Please fix this issue AS",1

Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"A true hogwarts experience! Great game if you're feeling nostalgic and want to occasionally play. The game does run on an ""only so much energy per action"" style, so I would recommend more casual, every once in a while play unless you're willing to pay. Edit: I lowered my rating because some performa",1
Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"The game is overall just okay, it seems to have lost a lot of its charm after year 4. I really hate games that tie you to your phone every couple of hours, and this is the majority of this game's mechanics. Checking your phone every two hours to complete an event gets really stressful; it's my bigge",1
Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"Overall, this game is a pretty great game! my only complaint is that the energy takes too long to fill. Sometimes it can make the game a bit boring or it annoys you because you cant finish a lesson. I suggest you lower the time it takes for the energy to load. Like, instead of 4 mins, why not 3 or 2",1
